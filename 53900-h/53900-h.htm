<h2><span class="lsp2">PREFACE.</span></h2>
<hr class="r30a" />

<p class="noindent">The character and credit of the British Army must chiefly
depend upon the zeal and ardour, by which all who enter
into its service are animated, and consequently it is of the
highest importance that any measure calculated to excite the
spirit of emulation, by which alone great and gallant actions
are achieved, should be adopted.</p>

<p>Nothing can more fully tend to the accomplishment of
this desirable object, than a full display of the noble deeds
with which the Military History of our country abounds.
To hold forth these bright examples to the imitation of the
youthful soldier, and thus to incite him to emulate the
meritorious conduct of those who have preceded him in their
honourable career, are among the motives that have given
rise to the present publication.</p>

<p>The operations of the British Troops are, indeed, announced
in the "London Gazette," from whence they are
transferred into the public prints: the achievements of our
armies are thus made known at the time of their occurrence,
and receive the tribute of praise and admiration to which
they are entitled. On extraordinary occasions, the Houses
of Parliament have been in the habit of conferring on the
Commanders, and the Officers and Troops acting under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
their orders, expressions of approbation and of thanks for
their skill and bravery, and these testimonials, confirmed by
the high honour of their Sovereign's Approbation, constitute
the reward which the soldier most highly prizes.</p>

<p>It has not, however, until late years, been the practice
(which appears to have long prevailed in some of the Continental
armies) for British Regiments to keep regular
records of their services and achievements. Hence some
difficulty has been experienced in obtaining, particularly
from the old Regiments, an authentic account of their origin
and subsequent services.</p>

<p>This defect will now be remedied, in consequence of His
Majesty having been pleased to command, that every Regiment
shall in future keep a full and ample record of its
services at home and abroad.</p>

<p>From the materials thus collected, the country will
henceforth derive information as to the difficulties and
privations which chequer the career of those who embrace
the military profession. In Great Britain, where so large a
number of persons are devoted to the active concerns of
agriculture, manufactures, and commerce, and where these
pursuits have, for so long a period, been undisturbed by the
<em>presence of war</em>, which few other countries have escaped,
comparatively little is known of the vicissitudes of active
service, and of the casualties of climate, to which, even
during peace, the British Troops are exposed in every part
of the globe, with little or no interval of repose.</p>

<p>In their tranquil enjoyment of the blessings which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
country derives from the industry and the enterprise of the
agriculturist and the trader, its happy inhabitants may be
supposed not often to reflect on the perilous duties of the
soldier and the sailor,&mdash;on their sufferings,&mdash;and on the
sacrifice of valuable life, by which so many national benefits
are obtained and preserved.</p>

<p>The conduct of the British Troops, their valour, and
endurance, have shone conspicuously under great and trying
difficulties; and their character has been established in Continental
warfare by the irresistible spirit with which they
have effected debarkations in spite of the most formidable
opposition, and by the gallantry and steadiness with which
they have maintained their advantages against superior
numbers.</p>

<p>In the official Reports made by the respective Commanders,
ample justice has generally been done to the gallant
exertions of the Corps employed; but the details of their
services, and of acts of individual bravery, can only be fully
given in the Annals of the various Regiments.</p>

<p>These Records are now preparing for publication, under
His Majesty's special authority, by Mr. <span class="smcap">Richard Cannon</span>,
Principal Clerk of the Adjutant-General's Office; and while
the perusal of them cannot fail to be useful and interesting
to military men of every rank, it is considered that they will
also afford entertainment and information to the general
reader, particularly to those who may have served in the
Army, or who have relatives in the Service.</p>

<p>There exists in the breasts of most of those who have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
served, or are serving, in the Army, an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Esprit de Corps</i>&mdash;an
attachment to every thing belonging to their Regiment;
to such persons a narrative of the services of their own Corps
cannot fail to prove interesting. Authentic accounts of the
actions of the great,&mdash;the valiant,&mdash;the loyal, have always
been of paramount interest with a brave and civilized people.
Great Britain has produced a race of heroes who, in moments
of danger and terror, have stood, "firm as the rocks
of their native shore;" and when half the World has been
arrayed against them, they have fought the battles of their
Country with unshaken fortitude. It is presumed that a
record of achievements in war,&mdash;victories so complete and
surprising, gained by our countrymen,&mdash;our brothers,&mdash;our
fellow-citizens in arms,&mdash;a record which revives the memory
of the brave, and brings their gallant deeds before us, will
certainly prove acceptable to the public.</p>

<p>Biographical memoirs of the Colonels and other distinguished
Officers, will be introduced in the Records of their
respective Regiments, and the Honorary Distinctions which
have, from time to time, been conferred upon each Regiment,
as testifying the value and importance of its services,
will be faithfully set forth.</p>

<p>As a convenient mode of Publication, the Record of each
Regiment will be printed in a distinct number, so that when
the whole shall be completed, the Parts may be bound up
in numerical succession.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1688</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Queen's Own Regiment of Hussars</span> was
originally a corps of heavy cavalry, and was
formed of independent troops of horse and dragoons,
raised in Scotland during the commotions
which followed the Revolution of 1688, when a
number of patriotic Scots arrayed themselves,
under the banners of William and Mary, and
fought against the adherents of King James II.,
who sought to establish papacy and arbitrary government.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1689</div>

<p>After King James's flight to France, England
became comparatively tranquil, and the
establishment of the Prince and Princess of
Orange on the throne, in February, 1689, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
hailed with public rejoicings. In Scotland, the
Catholic clans, and other partisans of King James
were numerous; and, while the chivalrous Viscount
Dundee aroused the Highlanders to arms,
the Duke of Gordon held the castle of Edinburgh,
of which he was governor, in the interest of the
Stuart dynasty.</p>

<p>King William sent Major-General Mackay,
an experienced officer, who had served in the
armies of France and Holland, to take the command
of the forces in Scotland; and, while
Viscount Dundee was organising a plan of co-operation
among the clans, additional corps were
embodied by the government.</p>

<p>The Earl of Annandale, who was one of the
first of the Scottish noblemen to advocate the
principles of the Revolution, raised a troop of
horse; a second was raised by the Lord Belhaven,
a nobleman distinguished for his steady opposition
to the tyrannical measures of King Charles II.,
and King James II.; and a third troop was raised
by William, Laird of Blair: independent troops
of dragoons were also embodied by several gentlemen
who were zealous for the interests and
welfare of their country; also several regiments
and independent companies of foot.</p>

<p>While these corps were being embodied, Viscount
Dundee descended from the mountains
with several bands of Highlanders, seized on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
town of Perth, and took the Laird of Blair, and
his lieutenant, the Laird of Pollock, prisoners.
These gentlemen were carried about like felons,
in an ungenerous triumph, for six weeks, and
afterwards sent to the Isle of Mul, where the
Laird of Blair died, in consequence of the barbarous
treatment he received.</p>

<p>The Earl of Annandale's and Lord Belhaven's
troops of horse, having been completed and
equipped, took the field, and formed part of the
force under Major-General Mackay, which engaged
the Highlanders and Irish, under Viscount
Dundee, at the pass of <em>Killicrankie</em>, on the 27th
of July, 1689, and were the only cavalry corps
with the army on that occasion<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>. For a short
time after the commencement of the action, the
advantage was on the side of Major-General
Mackay. When the infantry began to give way
before the superior numbers of the clans, the two
troops of horse were ordered forward,&mdash;one on the
right, and the other on the left,&mdash;to attack the
flanks of the opposing army; but, being untrained
men, instead of dashing, sword in hand, upon the
adverse ranks, they halted at a short distance, and
commenced a straggling fire with carbines and
pistols. This mode of attacking a body of men
on foot of very superior numbers, could not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>fail to prove disastrous; and the two troops were
speedily driven from the field with loss. The
army was defeated; but the ability evinced by
Major-General Mackay, in conducting the retreat,
and in assembling another army, with the loss of
the Jacobite commander, Viscount Dundee, who
was killed at the commencement of the action,
occasioned the result to be less disastrous than
was anticipated, and the Highlanders were forced
to take refuge in their mountain fastnesses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1690</div>

<p>In the beginning of 1690 the newly-raised
horse were formed into a regiment, of only three
troops, of which the Earl of Eglintoun was appointed
colonel,&mdash;the Honorable William Forbes
(eldest son of Lord Forbes), lieut.-colonel,&mdash;and
Sir George Gordon, of Edinglassie, major; the
dragoons were also formed into a regiment of
three troops, under the command of Lord Cardross,&mdash;Jackson,
lieut.-colonel, and&mdash;Guthrie, major;
at the same time three of the newly-raised
regiments of foot were incorporated into one,
which were placed under the orders of Colonel
Cunningham.</p>

<p>During the subsequent contest the two
cavalry corps performed much harassing and
faithful service; they took part in several skirmishes,
and evinced intrepidity and valour; the
clans were repulsed and driven back to the
mountains; garrisons were placed in the heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
of the Highland districts, and the adherents of
King James lost all hope of success.</p>

<p>In the following winter the Scots army was
remodelled; several corps of infantry were disbanded;
and the two regiments of cavalry, of
three troops each, were incorporated and constituted
a regiment of dragoons, of six troops of
fifty men each, of which <span class="smcap">Robert Cunningham</span>
was appointed colonel by commission dated the
30th of December, 1690; William Forbes was
appointed lieut.-colonel; and Patrick Hume,
major. The corps thus formed now bears the
distinguished title of the <span class="smcap">Seventh, or Queen's
Own, Regiment of Hussars</span>, and its services
form the subject of the following pages. Until
the reign of King George II., it was distinguished
by the name of its colonel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1691<br />1692</div>

<p>Being constituted of men of approved fidelity
and devotion to the principles of the Revolution,
<span class="smcap">Cunningham's</span> regiment was held in estimation
by the government; it was quartered near the
confines of the Highlands, to hold in check the
disaffected clans; and was afterwards removed to
the vicinity of Edinburgh. In August, 1691, a
proclamation was published, proffering indemnity
and pardon to all persons who would submit to
the government and take the oath of allegiance
to King William and Queen Mary. Before the
end of January, 1692, the heads of clans had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
ratified their submission, and hostilities ceased in
Scotland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1693</div>

<p>The British monarch had, in the mean time,
engaged in a war with Louis XIV., and on His
Majesty's return to England, after the termination
of the campaign of 1693, the two Scots regiments
of dragoons (Livingstone's, now Second, or
the Scots' Greys, and <span class="smcap">Cunningham's</span>, now <span class="smcap">Seventh
Hussars</span>) were selected to proceed on foreign
service.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1694</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Cunningham's</span> dragoons commenced their
march from Scotland in February, 1694, and on
arriving at Berwick they were placed on the
English establishment; at the same time exertions
were made to complete an augmentation
of two troops, and of ten additional men and
horses to each of the six old troops. The augmentation
troops left Scotland in the spring, and
the six old troops continued their march southward
until they arrived at London, where the
eight troops were united in May, and the whole
embarked at Greenwich for the Netherlands.</p>

<p>The regiment, commanded by its colonel,
Robert Cunningham, landed at Williamstadt, in
North Brabant, on the 31st of May; advanced up
the country to the vicinity of Arschot, and was
reviewed by King William on the 16th of June,
together with Livingstone's regiment: and the
hardy and warlike appearance of the Scots troopers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
elicited the commendations of His Majesty, and
of the British and foreign general officers present
at the review.</p>

<p>After several marches the regiment was encamped
at Mont St. André, where an army of
eighty-eight thousand men of several nations was
assembled under the command of the British
monarch, and <span class="smcap">Cunningham's</span> dragoons were formed
in brigade with Eppinger's (foreign), Essex's (now
fourth), and Wynne's (late fifth), regiments of
dragoons, under the orders of Brigadier-General
Wynne. No general engagement occurred; and
after taking part in the operations of a toilsome
campaign, the regiment went into cantonments for
the winter among the Flemish peasantry, in the
villages between Ghent and Sas van Ghent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1695</div>

<p>From its winter quarters, the regiment marched
in April, 1695, to Dixmude, in West Flanders; it
joined the army in May, at the camp at Arseele,
and was formed in brigade with Dopf's (Dutch)
dragoons under Brigadier-General Wynne.</p>

<p>In the beginning of June, the army advanced
to Becelaer. On the 14th of that month five
hundred dragoons (among whom was a large detachment
from <span class="smcap">Cunningham's</span> regiment) under the
command of the Earl of Portland and Brigadier-General
Wynne, left the camp with the view of
intercepting a numerous French force, which was
moving quietly across the country to attack the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
bread-waggons of the confederate army, on their
way from Bruges to the camp. On arriving at
<em>Moorsleede</em>, the French detachment was found in
the village, with the streets barricaded with waggons
and implements of husbandry. The dragoons
instantly dismounted and attacked the barricades
with signal gallantry, <span class="smcap">Cunningham's</span> men evincing
true Scottish heroism; and in a few moments the
French gave way and fled, leaving a number of
killed and wounded behind them, and one captain
and thirty men prisoners. Count de Soissons,
brother of Prince Eugene of Savoy, served as a
volunteer on this occasion, and expressed, in the
strongest terms, his admiration of the valour of
the dragoons. Lieutenant Webb, and several
men were killed; Captains Collins and Holgate
were wounded. Brigadier-General Wynne, who
commanded the brigade of which <span class="smcap">Cunningham's</span>
dragoons formed part, received a severe wound of
which he afterwards died.</p>

<p>When King William undertook the siege of
the important fortress of <em>Namur</em>, the regiment
formed part of the covering army under Charles
Henry of Lorraine, Prince of Vaudemont, and on
the evening of the 14th of July, it was formed in
order of battle, while the immense columns of the
enemy, commanded by Marshal Villeroy, were seen
in the open grounds in front. The two armies
confronted each other during the night, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
French commander, having an immense superiority
of numbers, detached a division to turn the right
flank of the confederate army. The Prince
ordered a retreat, which he masked with judgment;
the cavalry advancing to the front&mdash;the
dragoons dismounting and forming on foot at extended
files, while the artillery, and infantry, with
their pikes trailed and colours furled, quietly
withdrew. The enemy prepared for the attack,
and sent forward a cloud of light musketeers to
commence the action; but the dragoons retired
a few paces and mounted their horses, and when
the enemy thought to have commenced the battle,
the skeleton squadrons withdrew; presenting to the
astonished French what appeared to be the magic
spectacle of an army vanishing out of sight. The
enemy's horsemen galloped forward in pursuit;
but the allies effected their retreat in good order
to Ghent, from whence <span class="smcap">Cunningham's</span> dragoons
were detached, with Rosse's troopers, and twelve
battalions of infantry under Lieut.-General Sir
Henry Bellasis, to cover Nieuport, a place celebrated
for the victory gained by the English and
Dutch, over the Spaniards under Archduke Albert,
on the 2nd of July, 1600<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>.</p>

<p>The regiment was stationed between Bruges
and Nieuport, until Marshal Villeroy advanced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>towards Namur with the view of raising the siege,
when it proceeded to Brussels, which city the
French had, a short time previously, bombarded.
The enemy's designs were frustrated; Namur was
captured; the regiment left Brussels, and, after
encamping a short time on the Bruges canal, went
into cantonments in the villages on the banks of
the canal of Ostend, in the Pays du Nord.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1696</div>

<p>When the army took the field to serve the
campaign of 1696, the excellent condition of this
corps excited admiration; it mustered four strong
squadrons, and when King William saw the regiment,
he promoted its colonel, <span class="smcap">Robert Cunningham</span>,
to the rank of brigadier-general.</p>

<p>During the summer of this year the regiment
served with the army of Flanders under the Prince
of Vaudemont, and was brigaded with the regiments
of Eppinger and Miremont, commanded by
its colonel. It was employed in defensive operations
for the preservation of Ghent, Bruges, and
the maritime towns of Flanders. It passed the
winter in the villages behind the Bruges canal.</p>

<p>On the 1st of October, 1696, Brigadier-General
Cunningham was succeeded in the colonelcy
by <span class="smcap">William, Lord Jedburgh</span>, eldest son of the
Marquis of Lothian.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1697</div>

<p>The regiment, bearing the title of <span class="smcap">Jedburgh's</span>
dragoons, served the campaign of 1697 in Flanders
with the army commanded by the Elector of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Bavaria, and was formed in brigade with the regiments
of Nassau-Sarbruck, and Opdam, under the
orders of Brigadier-General Pyper. It took part
in several operations; and in May joined King
William's army in Brabant, but, subsequently,
returned to Flanders. In September tranquillity
was restored in Europe by the treaty of Ryswick.</p>

<p>During the winter <span class="smcap">Jedburgh's</span> dragoons embarked
from Flanders, and after landing at Harwich
in December, proceeded to London, where
they occupied quarters for several weeks; at the
same time their numbers were reduced to a peace
establishment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1698</div>

<p>The regiment left its cantonments in Southwark,
in February, 1698, on route for Scotland,
where it arrived towards the end of March.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1702<br />1703<br />1704<br />1705<br />1706</div>

<p>The accession of Queen Anne, in 1702, was
followed by another war on the continent; but
the exertions made by the friends of the Pretender
to effect his elevation to the throne, rendered it
necessary to detain an efficient force at home, and
Jedburgh's was one of the corps selected to remain
in Scotland, where it was stationed, while the
army under the renowned Marlborough was gaining
laurels in Germany and the Netherlands<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>the fields of Blenheim, Ramilies, &amp;c., giving
dreadful proof of British valour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1707</div>

<p>In April, 1707, Patrick Lord Polwarth was
appointed colonel of the regiment, in succession
to the Marquis of Lothian, who was removed to
the colonelcy of the Scots foot guards.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1708</div>

<p>The king of France having fitted out a fleet
and embarked troops in the early part of 1708,
for the invasion of Britain by the Pretender, Lord
Polwarth's regiment was held in readiness to take
the field at a moment's notice, and the establishment
was augmented to fifty-four men per troop;
but the French fleet was driven from the Scottish
coast, and the country was preserved from the
horrors of civil war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1709</div>

<p>In October, 1709, Lord Polwarth was succeeded
in the colonelcy by William Kerr, brother
of the duke of Roxburgh.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1710<br />1711</div>

<p>The gallant achievements of the forces under
the great duke of Marlborough had, in the mean
time, removed the theatre of war from the frontiers
of Holland to the confines of France; Louis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
XIV. assembled an immense army to preserve the
interior of his kingdom from the power of his
opponents; and Queen Anne sent additional corps
to the scene of contest. <span class="smcap">Kerr's</span> dragoons were
selected to proceed to the Netherlands; their
establishment was augmented, in March, 1711,
to sixty men per troop; and in the same month
they embarked at Leith, but were driven back to
the Frith and detained by contrary winds until
the end of April, when they sailed for Holland.</p>

<p>Having been detained by the weather, the
regiment did not arrive until the army had taken
the field, and the men and horses had suffered by
being so long on board of ship; they consequently
remained in Holland for a short time in quarters
of refreshment, and afterwards commenced their
march for the frontiers; but when passing through
Brabant, they were ordered to halt at Brussels.
The regiment appears to have remained in reserve
during the campaign of this year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1712</div>

<p>Taking the field in the spring of 1712, the
regiment formed part of the army commanded by
his grace the duke of Ormond, which advanced
to the confines of France, and was ready to carry
the war into Picardy; but the French monarch,
finding his generals overmatched, and his armies
beaten and dispirited, agreed to the conditions of
a treaty of peace. A suspension of hostilities
was proclaimed, and the army retired to Ghent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and after encamping a short period went into
quarters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1713</div>

<p>In the summer of 1713 the regiment was
ordered to embark at Dunkirk for Ireland. The
royal dragoons had, in the mean time, returned
from Spain dismounted<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>, and the government,
contemplating the disbanding of <span class="smcap">Kerr's</span> regiment,
directed its horses to be embarked for Dover and
delivered to the royal dragoons. The following
order was received on this subject:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">"ANNE R.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Our</span> will and pleasure is, that upon the
embarkation of our regiment of dragoons under
your command, for our kingdom of Ireland, you
cause all the horses belonging to the non-commissioned
officers and private dragoons thereof
to be delivered over to such person or persons
as shall be appointed to receive the same; your
said regiment being to continue unmounted
until further orders.</p>

<p>"Given at our court at Kensington, this 6th day
of June, 1713, in the twelfth year of our reign.</p>

<p class="right">

commanding one of our regiments of dragoons,<br />
Flanders.</em><br />
</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>The regiment arrived at Dunkirk on the 15th
of August, and having delivered up its horses,
embarked for Ireland on the 21st of that month.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1714</div>

<p>After the conclusion of the treaty of Utrecht,
the strength of the army was reduced, and Colonel
<span class="smcap">Kerr's</span> regiment of dragoons was disembodied in
Ireland in the spring of 1714.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1715</div>

<p>At the time this regiment was reduced, the
royal dragoons and Scots greys were augmented,
and many men from Kerr's dragoons entered these
two veteran corps. Few months, however, elapsed
after the decease of Queen Anne, (1st August,
1714,) and the accession of King George I., when a
change took place in the circumstances of the British
court. His Majesty arrived from Hanover on
the 17th of September. The result of the measures
pursued by the ministry of Queen Anne, during
the last three years of her reign, was soon manifested
in the prevalence of Jacobin principles, and
the king found it necessary to augment the army.
One of the first acts of His Majesty on this occasion,
was the restoration of <span class="smcap">Kerr's</span> regiment of
dragoons, now the <span class="smcap">Seventh, or Queen's Own
Hussars</span>, by a warrant under the sign manual, of
which the following is a copy:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">"GEORGE R.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Whereas</span> we have thought fit that a regiment

under your command, to consist of one colonel,
one lieut.-colonel, one major, one chaplain, one
adjutant, one chirurgeon, and six troops, each consisting
of one captain, one lieutenant, one cornet,
one quarter-master, one serjeant, two corporals,
one drummer, one hautboy, and thirty private
dragoons, (including two for widows.) And,

as shall be wanting to complete and fill up the

the numbers aforesaid. And all magistrates,
justices of the peace, constables, and other of
our officers, whom it may concern, are required
to be assisting unto you, in providing quarters,
impressing carriages, and otherwise, as there
shall be occasion.</p>

<p>"Given at our court at St. James', this 3rd
day of February, 1714-15, in the first year of
our reign.</p>

</p>

<p class="negin1 fs80">
<em>To our trusty and well-beloved<br />
Colonel William Kerr.</em><br />
</p></div>

<p>In compliance with this order, Captains Lewis
Dollon's and Peter Renourds' troops from the
royal dragoons, and Captains William Crawford's,
George Dunbar's and James Levingtone's troops
from the greys, (being augmentation troops raised
when <span class="smcap">Kerr's</span> regiment was disembodied,) with a
sixth troop raised near London, were constituted
a regiment, which now bears the designation of
<span class="smcap">Seventh, or Queen's own Hussars</span>; but was
then styled "KERR'S DRAGOONS."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon after its second formation, the regiment
marched into quarters in Yorkshire, Lancashire,
and the county of Durham; and in July His
Majesty was pleased to confer upon it the distinguished
title of "<span class="smcap">Her Royal Highness the
Princess of Wales' own Royal Regiment of
Dragoons</span>"<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> in honour of Wilhelmina Carolina,
consort of his Royal Highness the Prince of
Wales.</p>

<p>The augmentation of the army, and other measures
adopted by the government for the preservation
of tranquillity, did not sufficiently intimidate
the disaffected so as to prevent an appeal to
arms. In the early part of September the Earl of
Mar raised the standard of the Pretender in the
Highlands, and summoned the friends of the
Stuart dynasty to his aid. At the same time, the
<span class="smcap">Princess of Wales's</span> dragoons were ordered to
march to Scotland and join the troops commanded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>by Major-General Whetham, encamped at Stirling.</p>

<p>At this camp the regiment remained several
weeks; additional forces arrived; the establishment
was augmented, and the Duke of Argyle
took the command of the army. The rebel forces,
ten thousand strong, advancing with the view of
penetrating southward, the King's troops, not four
thousand men, proceeded to the vicinity of <em>Dumblain</em>,
to oppose the progress of the clans. On
the morning of Sunday, the 13th of November,
the two armies confronted each other on Sheriff-muir,
and the <span class="smcap">Princess of Wales'</span>, with Carpenter's
(third), and a squadron of the Inniskilling
(sixth) dragoons were on the left of the line,
under Major-General Sabine and Brigadier-General
Newton. The action commenced on the right,
where the royal forces overthrew their opponents
and chased them from the field. On the left the
fortune of the day was in favour of the rebels; six
hundred select Highlanders surprised the infantry
in the act of forming, and put them into confusion.
The gallant Colonel <span class="smcap">Kerr</span> led his regiment
of dragoons (the <span class="smcap">Seventh</span>) to the charge with
signal intrepidity; his horse was killed under
him; but he speedily mounted another, and his
brave troopers, with some gentlemen volunteers
and Carpenter's squadrons, drove the rebel horsemen
before them, capturing a standard. Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Kerr</span> had a second horse killed under him, and a
rebel trooper fired a pistol at his breast, which
did him no harm, although his coat was torn. The
royal infantry on the left were unable to recover
from the disorder into which they had fallen; they
retired before the clans; their communication
with the remainder of the army was cut off; and
mingling with the cavalry, both became confused,
and fell back a short distance to gain an opportunity
of re-forming their ranks. They retired
beyond Dumblain, and took possession of the
passes, to prevent the clans penetrating to Stirling.
Meanwhile, the right wing of the king's
army had returned from the pursuit of the left
wing of the rebel forces: the Earl of Mar withdrew
with the clans during the night, and the
Duke of Argyle returned with the royal forces to
Stirling.</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Kerr</span> lost three horses on this occasion;
the regiment had also two troop horses
killed, and one man and four horses wounded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1716</div>

<p>In January, 1716, the royal army, having been
augmented, advanced against the rebels, who
fled in every direction. The Pretender and his
principal officers escaped to the continent; the
common men dispersed; and the rebellion being
suppressed, the regiment went into quarters in
Fife.</p>

<p>In the following spring, the <span class="smcap">Princess of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Wales'</span> dragoons returned to England, and occupied
quarters in Yorkshire; but proceeded southward
during the summer; and in December one
troop was ordered to attend His Majesty on his
landing from Hanover.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1717<br />1718</div>

<p>The regiment occupied quarters in Lincolnshire
in the summer of 1717; passed the following
winter in Yorkshire; and in July, 1718, was reviewed
by Major-General Macartney, at Leicester.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1719<br />1720</div>

<p>In July, 1719, one troop was employed in suppressing
riots at Halifax. In December, <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: '1720, the the regiment'">1720, the
regiment</ins> was occupying quarters in Lancashire,
and received orders not to permit any person
to land from the Isle of Man, in consequence of a
report that the plague was in that island.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1721<br />1722<br />1723<br />1724</div>

<p>The regiment marched to Scotland in April,
1721; it returned to England in April, 1722;
and after encamping several months near Manchester,
went into quarters in the town. It
encamped near York in June, 1723, from whence
it marched, in the autumn, into Berkshire; and
in January, 1724, detachments were employed on
revenue duty on the Hampshire and Dorsetshire
coast; in April following, the remainder marched
into Yorkshire and Durham.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1725<br />1726</div>

<p>Lieut.-General Carpenter reviewed the regiment
at York, in September, 1725; and Lieut.-General
Sir Charles Wills, in April, 1726.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1727</div>

<p>On the prospect of war between Holland and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the Emperor of Germany, the regiment was
augmented, in February, 1727, to nine troops,
and four regiments of cavalry and eight of infantry
were held in readiness to assist the Dutch;
but no embarkation took place.</p>

<p>King George I. died in June of this year, on
his journey to Hanover; and his son, George,
Prince of Wales, succeeded to the throne: the
Princess of Wales became Queen, and this regiment
was honoured with the title of "<span class="smcap">The
Queen's Own Regiment of Dragoons</span>." It
marched to the vicinity of Hounslow in October,
and was reviewed on the heath, on the 28th of
that month, by King George II., who was pleased
to express his high approbation of its appearance
and discipline. After the review it marched into
cantonments in Dorsetshire and Somersetshire,
with a detachment on revenue duty on the
Sussex coast.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1728</div>

<p>A detachment attended the Princess Amelia
at Bath, in May, 1728; in July the regiment was
reviewed at Salisbury; and in the autumn another
detachment was ordered to attend the Princess
Amelia at Bath.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1729<br />1730<br />1731</div>

<p>In 1729 the establishment was reduced from
nine to six troops. In 1730 the regiment occupied
cantonments in Dorsetshire, Somersetshire,
and Wiltshire; and was reviewed on Hounslow-heath,
on the 15th of May, 1731, by King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
George II., attended by several noblemen and
general officers; its warlike appearance, the condition
of the horses, and the discipline of the
regiment, were commended.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1732<br />1733<br />1734</div>

<p>After the review, the <span class="smcap">Queen's Own Dragoons</span>
returned to their former quarters; in 1732 they
were removed to Gloucestershire and Herefordshire;
and in April, 1733, they commenced their
march for Scotland, where they remained during
the following year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1735<br />1736<br />1737<br />1738<br />1739</div>

<p>Returning to England in April, 1735, the
<span class="smcap">Queen's Own</span> dragoons proceeded into quarters
in Leicestershire and Staffordshire, with detachments
on revenue duty on the coasts of Lincolnshire
and Norfolk, in which duties they were
employed during the remainder of that and in
the two succeeding years; and in 1738 they
marched into quarters in Herefordshire and
Gloucestershire. In 1739 they furnished detachments
on coast duty in Sussex; at the same,
war having been declared against Spain, the
establishment was augmented to four hundred
and thirty-five men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1740<br />1741</div>

<p>During the summer of 1740, the <span class="smcap">Queen's
Own</span> dragoons were encamped, with four other
regiments of cavalry and four of infantry, near
Newbury, under the orders of Lieut.-General
Wade; and subsequently near Kingsclear; in
October the regiment marched from the camp to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
cantonments in Gloucestershire and Monmouthshire.
In 1741 they marched into Scotland.</p>

<p>The Honourable William Kerr, after commanding
the regiment upwards of thirty years
with reputation to himself, and advantage to the
service, was succeeded in the colonelcy by Major-General
Sir John Cope, K.B., by commission,
dated the 12th of August, 1741.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the death of Charles VI.,
Emperor of Germany, had been followed by war
on the continent; and the Elector of Bavaria,
aided by the French monarch, was endeavouring
to deprive the Archduchess, Maria Theresa, of
the kingdoms of Hungary and Bohemia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1742</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Queen's Own</span> dragoons left Scotland in
April, 1742: and soon after their arrival in England,
they were selected to form part of an army
of sixteen thousand men, sent to the Netherlands
under the command of Field-Marshal the Earl of
Stair, to support the interests of the Queen of
Hungary and Bohemia. The regiment embarked
in the early part of August; and after landing at
Ostend, marched a few stages up the country,
where it halted until the beginning of the following
year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1743</div>

<p>In February, 1743, the regiment commenced
its march for Germany; and after taking part in
several manœuvres, it was encamped at Aschaffenburg,
where King George II. and the Duke of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Cumberland joined the army. On the 26th of
June, as the troops were marching along the bank
of the river Maine, a French force was discovered
in position near <em>Dettingen</em>, a village in the Bavarian
States, in the circle of the Lower Rhine; and
King George II. commanded the British, Austrians,
and Hanoverians to form line opposite the
enemy. After a severe cannonade of several
hours' duration, the French advanced from their
formidable position, and a series of charges of
cavalry, with a heavy fire of musketry, commenced
on the left of the allied army, and extended along
the front. During the heat of the engagement,
the regiment which forms the subject of this memoir,
had an opportunity of displaying its intrepidity
and prowess in close combat with the cavalry
of the opposing army, and obtained the approbation
of its sovereign. The British dragoons
encountered the French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gens d'armes</i> and household
cavalry, and, though without armour, they
fought their steel-clad opponents with signal
gallantry. Twice the British horsemen were
forced back; but, rallying and returning to the
charge, at the third onset they overthrew the
opposing squadrons, and chased them from the
field with great slaughter, and with the loss of
several standards and kettle drums. The infantry
of the allied army evinced great bravery, and a
complete victory was gained over the enemy.</p>

    <div class="chapter"></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Queen's Own</span> regiment of dragoons had
Lieutenant Falconer, Cornet Hobey, one serjeant,
ten rank and file, and twenty-two horses killed;
Lieutenant Frazer, Cornet St. Leger, one quarter-master,
two serjeants, thirteen rank and file, and
thirteen horses wounded: Cornet St. Leger afterwards
died of his wounds.</p>

<p>After passing the night in the open grounds
near the field of battle, the regiment marched on
the following day to Hanau, and was subsequently
encamped with the army on the banks of the
Kinzig. In the early part of August the king
proceeded towards the Rhine, passed that river
beyond Mentz, and advanced to Worms. The
<span class="smcap">Queen's Own</span> dragoons were employed in West
Germany, but nothing of importance occurred;
and in the autumn they re-passed the Rhine, and
marched back to Brabant and Flanders, where
they remained during the winter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1744</div>

<p>The regiment served the campaign of 1744
under Field-Marshal Wade, and was employed in
several movements, but no general engagement
occurred, and in the autumn it marched into
winter quarters at Bruges.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1745</div>

<p>The establishment having been augmented, the
regiment was joined in the spring of 1745, by a
number of men and horses from England. Soon
afterwards it took the field, and advanced with
the troops commanded by His Royal Highness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the Duke of Cumberland, to the relief of <em>Tournay</em>,
which fortress was besieged by an immense French
army. On the 10th of May, two troops of the
<span class="smcap">Queen's Own</span> dragoons were employed in
driving back the enemy's out-guards and piquets;
and on the following day, they were engaged in
supporting the attack of the infantry on the formidable
position, occupied by the French, near
the village of <em>Fontenoy</em>. The centre of the position
was twice forced by the British regiments;
but the Dutch having failed in their point of attack,
a retreat was ordered. Towards the close of the
action, several squadrons of cavalry charged with
signal intrepidity, but were unable to retrieve the
fortune of the day, and the army withdrew to
Aeth.</p>

<p>The regiment lost, on this occasion, ten men,
and forty-six horses killed; Lieut.-Colonel Erskine,
Captain-Lieutenant Ogilvy, Lieutenant Forbes,
Cornet Maitland, Quartermaster Smith, thirty-five
men, and forty-seven horses wounded; one man and
two horses missing.</p>

<p>After the capture of Tournay, the French
army advanced with such overwhelming numbers,
that the allies were unable to prevent the loss of
several important towns. The <span class="smcap">Queen's Own</span>
dragoons were employed in defensive operations,
and were encamped a short time before Brussels.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1746</div>

<p>Meanwhile, a rebellion had broken out in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Scotland, and Charles Edward, eldest son of the
Pretender, was at the head of the insurgent clans.
Several corps were ordered to return to England;
and in February, 1746, the <span class="smcap">Queen's Own</span> dragoons
proceeded to Williamstadt and embarked;
but some delay was occasioned by severe weather,
and one transport was stranded. The regiment
disembarked to wait for more favourable weather;
in the mean time, the prospect of a speedy termination
to the rebellion occasioned the order for its
return to be countermanded.</p>

<p>The war on the continent was continued; the
regiment, having received a remount of one hundred
and two men, and one hundred and fifty-six
horses, took the field in the summer of 1746,
and served on the Dutch frontiers, under the
command of General Sir John Ligonier, and
afterwards under Prince Charles of Lorraine. On
the 11th of October, the regiment was formed in
line, with the Greys and Inniskilling dragoons,
with its right behind <em>Roucoux</em>, a village near the
city of Liege, while the infantry occupied the
houses and streets of several hamlets along the
front. An immense French force, commanded
by Marshal Saxe, advanced and attacked the left
of the allied army; and by superior numbers,
succeeded in carrying the villages, and a retreat
was ordered. As the enemy's infantry emerged
from among the houses, the Greys, Inniskilling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
and <span class="smcap">Queen's Own</span> dragoons, dashed forward,
broke their ranks, and chased them back in gallant
style. The army afterwards withdrew to the
vicinity of Maestricht; and the regiment passed
the severe winter months in cantonments in the
country along the Lower Maese.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1747</div>

<p>In the spring of 1747, the regiment encamped
a short period near the banks of the Scheldt, and
was subsequently employed in operations on the
Great Nethe and the Demer, during which period
a remount of fifty men and one hundred and
twenty horses, joined from England. On the
1st of July, it confronted the French army in one
of the valleys in the province of Liege, and passed
the night in a state of constant readiness for
action.</p>

<p>The French infantry descended from the hills
on the following morning, and made a furious
attack on the troops stationed in the village of
<em>Val</em>. After much severe fighting, the enemy, by
means of a great superiority of numbers, forced
the centre of the Allied army. The cavalry of
the left wing was ordered forward, and the
<span class="smcap">Queen's Own</span> dragoons had another opportunity
of distinguishing themselves. Having broken the
enemy's first line, the British dragoons continued
their victorious career, and overthrew a second
line with terrific violence; then, mixing with the
French horsemen and musketeers, used their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
broad swords with dreadful execution. While
pursuing their opponents, they received a volley
from some French infantry posted in a hollow,
and behind hedges, and several men and horses
fell mortally wounded. The survivors rushed
furiously upon the infantry, drove them from
behind the hedges, and pursued them across the
fields with great slaughter. This brilliant success
enabled the Duke of Cumberland to make arrangements
for a retreat; and the army withdrew
to Maestricht, where it arrived on the same
evening.</p>

<p>The regiment lost several men and horses on
this occasion; and had Cornet Bulmere, five men,
and ten horses captured by the enemy. It was
subsequently stationed a short time in the province
of Limburg, and was employed in various
operations until the winter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1748</div>

<p>In the spring of 1748, the army again confronted
the enemy in the province of Limburg.
Preliminary articles for a treaty of peace were
agreed upon; a suspension of hostilities took
place, and the British troops went into cantonments
among the Dutch peasantry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1749</div>

<p>During the following winter, the treaty of
Aix-la-Chapelle was concluded. The British
troops left Holland; and the <span class="smcap">Queen's Own</span>
dragoons, after landing at Purfleet in January,
1749, were reduced to a peace establishment, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
quartered at Norwich and Yarmouth, with detachments
on coast duty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1750</div>

<p>The regiment was inspected by Lieutenant-General
Campbell at Wells, in April, 1750, and
at Gloucester in October following; and by Lieutenant-General
Onslow at Gloucester in April,
1751.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1751</div>

<p>On the 1st of July, 1751, King George II.
issued a warrant relative to the colours, standards,
and clothing of the several regiments, from which
the following particulars have been extracted
respecting the <span class="smcap">Seventh, or Queen's Own Regiment
of Dragoons</span>.</p>

on a crimson ground: the white horse on a scarlet
ground in the first and fourth compartments, and
<span class="fs70">VII. D.</span> within a wreath of roses and thistles upon

<div class="sidenote">1752<br />1753<br />1754</div>

<p>The regiment was inspected at Birmingham, in
October, 1751, by Lieutenant-General Sir Philip
Honeywood; at Lichfield, in April, 1752, by
Lieutenant-General Campbell; and at Manchester
in April, 1753, by Major-General Cholmondeley.
In October following it commenced its march to
Scotland, and remained in that part of the kingdom
upwards of four years, during which period
the undetermined limits of the British territory in
North America had given rise to another war with
France.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1755<br />1756<br />1757</div>

<p>Hostilities commenced in 1755, and the establishment
of the <span class="smcap">Queen's Own</span> dragoons was
augmented to three hundred and forty-seven
officers and men. A seventh troop was also added,
of which Captain-Lieutenant William Erskine was
appointed captain by commission dated the 25th
of December, 1755, and the officers and men of
this troop were mounted on small horses and
equipped as <em>light dragoons</em>. The establishment of
the light troop was fixed, by a royal warrant dated
the 29th of January, 1756, at three officers, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
quarter-master, two serjeants, two drummers, and
sixty-three rank and file; but it was subsequently
augmented to upwards of one hundred officers and
men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1758</div>

<p>In the spring of 1758 the <span class="smcap">Seventh</span> dragoons
quitted Scotland, and were stationed in Yorkshire,
the head-quarters being at York; from whence
the light troop was detached to Portsmouth to
take part in an expedition against the French
coast, under the orders of Charles Duke of Marlborough.
A brigade was formed of the light
troops of nine regiments of dragoons, under the
orders of Colonel Eliott, of the horse grenadier
guards; and when a landing had been effected
(6th June) on the coast of Brittany, the light
horsemen gave signal proof of their activity and
usefulness on several occasions. They took a
distinguished part in the capture of the suburbs
of <em>St. Maloes</em>, and in the destruction, by fire, of
the privateers and other vessels, amounting to
upwards of one hundred sail, in the harbour; also
in the destruction of extensive magazines of
maritime stores. The light cavalry subsequently
advanced several miles up the country, and evinced
zeal and activity in skirmishing with the French
troops. The expedition not being of sufficient
strength to undertake the siege of St. Maloes, the
troops re-embarked and returned to England.
The light cavalry subsequently took part in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
second enterprise against the French coast, under
the orders of Lieutenant-General Bligh, when
<span class="smcap">Cherbourg</span> was captured, and the works, with the
shipping in the harbour and iron ordnance were
destroyed, and the brass ordnance sent as trophies
to London. A second landing was also effected
near St. Maloes; but no advantage resulted, and
considerable loss was sustained on re-embarking.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1759</div>

<p>After landing at Portsmouth in September,
the light troop of the <span class="smcap">Queen's Own</span> proceeded to
Hackney, and afterwards to Romford; the remainder
of the regiment occupying cantonments
in Essex and Middlesex, from whence it marched,
in November, 1759, to Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire,
and Hertfordshire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1760</div>

<p>In the mean time Hanover and the adjoining
states had become the theatre of war, and a
British force, commanded by the gallant Marquis
of Granby, was serving with the troops of Hanover,
Hesse, and Brunswick, the whole commanded by
Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick; and in March,
1760, the six heavy troops of the <span class="smcap">Seventh</span> dragoons
received orders to proceed to Germany.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Queen's Own</span> dragoons, commanded by
Lieut.-Colonel George Lawson Hall, embarked on
the river Thames, and sailed for Germany in the
beginning of April: having a quick passage, they
arrived in the river Weser, landed above Bremen,
the capital of a duchy of the same name in Lower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Saxony, and joined the allied army commanded
by Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick, at the camp
on the heights of Fritzlar, in the principality of
Lower Hesse, on the 21st of April. They were
formed in brigade with the dragoons of Price-schenik,
under the orders of Colonel Bremar.</p>

<p>Being opposed by a French army of very
superior numbers, the allies were restricted to
defensive operations, and the <span class="smcap">Seventh</span> took part
in several toilsome marches and skirmishes. At
length thirty thousand French troops crossed the
river Dymel to cut off the communication of the
allies with Westphalia, and a favourable opportunity
occurring to attack this detached force, the
<span class="smcap">Queen's Own</span> dragoons, with several other corps,
under the Hereditary Prince of Brunswick, advanced
to Liebenau, where they passed the Dymel,
and making a detour of many miles, gained the
left flank of the enemy's position at <em>Warbourg</em>, on
the 31st of July. Prince Ferdinand <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'was advanceing'">was advancing</ins>
with the main body against the enemy's front;
but before his arrival, the enemy had been attacked
in flank and rear, and were retiring. The cavalry
under the Marquis of Granby and Lieut.-General
Mostyn arrived at a favourable moment; a gallant
charge of the British squadrons decided the fortune
of the day, and the French made a precipitate
retreat across the Dymel. The <span class="smcap">Seventh</span>
dragoons supported the infantry in the attack of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the enemy's flank, and by a spirited charge towards
the close of the action, contributed to the success
of the day. The conduct of the British cavalry
was commended by the Marquis of Granby, in his
public despatch, and Prince Ferdinand declared
in general orders, that "<em>all the British cavalry
performed prodigies of valour</em>." The regiment
being eager in the pursuit, had four men and
horses captured by the enemy; three of the men,
however, escaped and rejoined the regiment.</p>

<p>Lieut.-General Sir John Cope, K.B., died on
the 28th of July, 1760; and King George II.
conferred the colonelcy on Lieut.-General Mostyn,
from the fifth, royal Irish, regiment of dragoons.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Seventh</span> dragoons were encamped near
the banks of the Dymel, until winter, when the
soldiers were directed to build huts to protect
themselves and horses from severe weather. They
subsequently went into cantonments in the villages
in that part of the bishopric of Paderborn.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1761</div>

<p>The army was suddenly called from its winter
quarters in February, 1761, and penetrating,
during a heavy snow, into the enemy's cantonments,
captured several towns and extensive magazines
of forage and provision; but afterwards
returned to its former quarters, and the <span class="smcap">Seventh</span>
were again quartered in villages in the bishopric
of Paderborn.</p>

<p>On taking the field in the beginning of May,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
1761, the <span class="smcap">Seventh</span> were formed in brigade with
the Scots greys and Ancram's (eleventh) dragoons,
commanded by Colonel Harvey. After much
manœuvring, some skirmishing, and many long
and toilsome marches, they were encamped on
the heights of Denkernberg, between the rivers
Asse and Lippe, and formed part of the Marquis
Granby's corps, which had its right in front of the
village of <em>Kirch-Denkern</em>. This post was attacked
on the 15th, and again on the 16th of July; the
<span class="smcap">Seventh</span> were formed in column behind the centre
of this part of the position, and supported the
infantry; the enemy was repulsed; the cavalry
dashed forward, but were prevented charging by
the nature of the ground.</p>

<p>The regiment was subsequently employed in
operations which brought on slight skirmishes; but
no general engagement occurred. In August it
was employed on the Dymel. In the early part of
November it was engaged in dislodging a French
corps from a strong camp near <em>Escherhausen</em>, in
the duchy of Brunswick; and afterwards marched
to <em>Eimbeck</em>, where another skirmish occurred.
These movements were designed to surprise the
French army in dispersed quarters; but the
enemy having gained time to assemble his forces,
this regiment, with several other corps, marched
during the night of the 7th of November, through
a heavy snow to <em>Foorwohle</em>, where another skirmish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
occurred, and the British dragoons evinced signal
gallantry. The <span class="smcap">Seventh</span> were encamped in the
snow until the following morning, when the British
had another skirmish with their opponents; and
they subsequently marched to the heights between
Mackensen and Lithorst. When the army went
into winter quarters, the regiment was cantoned
in East Friesland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1762</div>

<p>The season for military operations having
arrived, the <span class="smcap">Queen's Own</span> dragoons again took
the field, and were encamped at Brackel, and
subsequently on the heights of Tissel: they were
formed in brigade with the Eleventh dragoons,
under Lieut.-Colonel George Lawson Hall, of the
<span class="smcap">Seventh</span>. They left their camp before day-break
on the morning of the 24th of June, 1762, and
having crossed the Dymel, advanced against the
French camp at <em>Groebenstein</em>. The enemy was
surprised, and made a precipitate retreat upon
Cassel, with the loss of their tents and baggage;
and one division being surrounded in the woods
of Wilhelmsthal, surrendered. The <span class="smcap">Seventh</span>
pursued the French in the direction of Cassel,
and took several prisoners; they subsequently
encamped near Holtzhausen.</p>

<p>During the remainder of the campaign, the
regiment continued actively employed, and was
frequently engaged in detached services; the
enemy was forced to abandon several important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
positions, and Cassel was captured by the allies.
Preliminary articles for a treaty of peace having
been agreed upon, a suspension of hostilities took
place, and the <span class="smcap">Queen's Own</span> dragoons, and other
British cavalry, went into quarters in the bishopric
of Munster.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1763</div>

<p>Peace having been concluded, the thanks of
Parliament were communicated to the army, and
in February, 1763, the <span class="smcap">Seventh</span> commenced
their march from Germany, through Holland, to
Williamstadt, where they embarked for England.
After landing at Harwich they were stationed at
Chelmsford, Springfield, and Colchester. The
light troop, which had not been on foreign service
with the other troops of the regiment, was disbanded;
and the establishment was reduced to
six troops of three officers, one quarter-master,
two serjeants, two corporals, one drummer, and
twenty-eight private men each; eight men per
troop were equipped as light dragoons, and the
remainder as heavy dragoons.</p>

<p>In May, 1763, Lieut.-General Mostyn was
removed to the First dragoon guards; and Major-General
Sir George Howard, K.B., was appointed
colonel of the <span class="smcap">Seventh</span> dragoons, from the third
foot, or buffs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1764</div>

<p>In January, 1764, a squadron was employed
on revenue duty on the Suffolk coast. On the
9th of April following, King George III. reviewed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the regiment in Hyde Park, and expressed his
high approbation of its appearance and discipline.
In the same year, orders were received for the
regiment to be mounted on long-tailed horses;&mdash;for
epaulettes to be worn on the left shoulder
instead of aiguillettes, and for the men's boots to
be of a lighter description than formerly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1765<br />1766</div>

<p>The regiment occupied quarters in Sussex, in
1765, and was removed to Northampton and
Leicestershire in 1766; at the same time, the
<span class="smcap">Drummers</span> on the establishment were directed to
be replaced by <span class="smcap">Trumpeters</span>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1767<br />1768<br />1769</div>

<p>From Leicestershire, &amp;c., the regiment was
removed to York in May, 1767, and to Scotland
in the spring of 1768, but returned to England in
the early part of 1769, and was quartered in
Warwickshire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1770<br />1771<br />1772<br />1773</div>

<p>In April, 1770, the regiment marched into
Dorsetshire and Somersetshire; in June, 1771, it
was removed to Canterbury, and employed on
coast duty until April, 1772, when it marched
into Northamptonshire, Leicestershire, and Lincolnshire.
In the spring of 1773 it commenced
its march for Scotland, where it was stationed
during the succeeding twelve months.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1774<br />1775<br />1776<br />1777</div>

<p>Returning to England in the summer of 1774,
the regiment was stationed in Lancashire; in
1775 it was removed into Worcestershire and
Staffordshire; in 1776 it was employed on revenue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
duty on the Sussex coast; and in 1777 it was
engaged in similar duties on the coasts of Norfolk
and Suffolk.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1778</div>

<p>In the summer of 1778 the <span class="smcap">Queen's Own</span>
dragoons were encamped near Bury St. Edmunds,
together with three other regiments of dragoons
and two battalions of militia, under the command
of Major-General Warde.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1779</div>

<p>Lieut.-General Sir George Howard, C.B., was
removed in April, 1779, to the first dragoon
guards, and King George III. conferred the command
of the <span class="smcap">Queen's Own</span> dragoons on Major-general
Sir Henry Clinton, K.B.</p>

<p>An augmentation had, in the mean time, been
made to the strength of the regiment, in consequence
of the American war; and in April, 1779,
the men, equipped as light dragoons, were incorporated,
with detachments from the second, third,
fifteenth, and sixteenth, into a regiment, which
was numbered the twenty-first light dragoons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1780<br />1781<br />1782<br />1783</div>

<p>Soon after this event the <span class="smcap">Seventh</span> dragoons
marched to Scotland, where they remained two
years, and on their arrival in England, in May,
1781, they were quartered at Durham. In the
summer of 1782 they were removed to Salisbury,
and in 1783 to Newbury.</p>

<p>The great usefulness of light cavalry had been
fully proved during the reign of King George II.,
and also during the American war; and after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
conclusion of a treaty of peace in 1783, the
<span class="smcap">Queen's Own</span> dragoons underwent a change of
clothing and equipment;&mdash;the cocked hats were
replaced by helmets; boots, saddles, belts, and
other articles of equipment, of a light construction,
were adopted; carbines of a smaller size than
those before used, were received; the standard
height for men and horses was reduced; and the
regiment was constituted a corps of <span class="smcap">Light Dragoons</span>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1784</div>

<p>The change of equipment having taken place,
the regiment was employed in the travelling
escort duty for the royal family; it was quartered
at Hounslow, and other villages, on the road from
London to Windsor; and during the summer of
1784 it was reviewed, on Hounslow heath, by
His Majesty, when its appearance and discipline
procured the expression of his royal approbation.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Seventh</span> Light Dragoons marched, in
the summer of 1785, into quarters in Sussex,
where the following order, dated Horse Guards,
February 6, 1786, was received:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;His Majesty has been pleased to order,
that the colonels commanding regiments of Light

<div class="sidenote">1786<br />1787<br />1788<br />1789</div>

<p>In May, 1786, the <span class="smcap">Seventh</span> dragoons were
removed to Guildford, and in July to Maidstone;
in 1787 they marched to Canterbury; and afterwards
to Greenwich and adjacent villages, from
whence they proceeded to Norwich; they passed
the summer of 1788 in Nottinghamshire; in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the following winter they proceeded to the
vicinity of London, and after occupying cantonments
at Staines a few months, resumed their
former quarters at Hounslow, &amp;c., in April, 1789,
and took part in the escort duty for the royal
family.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1790<br />1791<br />1792</div>

<p>Having been relieved from escort duty, the
regiment marched, in June, 1790, into cantonments
in Sussex, the head-quarters being established
at Lewes, from whence they were removed,
in April, 1791, to Brighton, and in June of the
same year to Canterbury. In the summer of
1792 the regiment marched to Nottingham.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1793</div>

<p>A revolution had in the mean time taken
place in France, and the tyrannical and barbarous
proceedings of the republicans, who had seized on
the powers of the government in that kingdom,
filled Europe with wonder and with abhorrence
of the ruthless perpetrators of the numerous
tragedies which took place; their crimes were
increased by the execution of their sovereign
Louis XVI.; the British ambassador consequently
received instructions to quit Paris, and active
preparations were made for war. Two troops
were added to the <span class="smcap">Queen's Own</span> light dragoons,
and in the spring of 1793 four troops, under the
command of Major Osborne, embarked for the
Netherlands, to form part of the army under
His Royal Highness the duke of York, designed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
to co-operate with the allies in repelling the
aggressions of the French republic on Holland
and the Austrian Netherlands. The depôt troops
were stationed at Manchester.</p>

<p>Having joined the forces commanded by the
duke of York, the two squadrons of the <span class="smcap">Seventh</span>
took part in the operations of the army. After
retiring from before Dunkirk, the troops re-assembled
at Furnes and Dixmude, and were stationed
for some time on the frontier of West Flanders.
His royal highness having resolved to make every
possible effort for the protection of the Austrian
Netherlands, determined to re-capture Menin,
and, as a diversion to favour this design, Major-General
Abercromby was directed to attack
<em>Lannoy</em> with a body of troops, of which a squadron
of the <span class="smcap">Seventh</span> formed a part. The attack
was made on the 28th of October: the French
having been driven from the town by the artillery,
the light dragoons galloped forward in pursuit
with distinguished gallantry, overtook their opponents,
cut down one hundred with their sabres,
took fifty-nine prisoners, and captured five pieces
of artillery, besides tumbrils and baggage waggons,
for which they were honoured with the approbation
of Major-General Abercromby and of His
Royal Highness the duke of York. The only
loss sustained by the <span class="smcap">Seventh</span>, on this occasion,
was two men wounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>The regiment performed much hard service on
out-post duty during the following winter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1794</div>

<p>On the 16th of April, 1794, the regiment
advanced to the heights above Cateau, where it
was reviewed by the emperor of Germany, and
on the succeeding day, supported the attack
of the infantry and artillery on <em>Prémont</em>,
<em>Vaux</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>When the siege of <em>Landrécies</em> was undertaken,
the <span class="smcap">Queen's Own</span> formed part of the covering
army encamped at <em>Cateau</em>. At day-break, on the
26th of April, while a thick fog covered the fields
and villages near the British camp, a few pistol-shots
in front gave indication that the advance-posts
were engaged, and soon afterwards the
piquets were seen retiring before crowds of
French, whose movements were partly concealed
by the fog. The <span class="smcap">Seventh</span> were speedily mounted
and formed in front of their camp-ground; the
cannonade became louder and louder, and the fog
clearing, the duke of York detached the cavalry
of the right wing to turn the enemy's left flank,
while the <span class="smcap">Seventh</span> and Eleventh light dragoons'
and two squadrons of Archduke Ferdinand's hussars,
supported by several other corps, moved
forward to reconnoitre the French column advancing
from Prémont and Marets. Encountering
their opponents in the plain of St. Celian, the
<span class="smcap">Seventh</span> and Eleventh light dragoons raised a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
loud shout and dashed furiously against the adverse
ranks of war, while the German hussars
joined gallantly in the charge, and the enemy was
overthrown and pursued with dreadful carnage.
The <span class="smcap">Seventh</span> were distinguished for their heroic
ardour and contempt of danger, and Lieutenant
O'Laughlin eminently signalized himself. Twelve
hundred Frenchmen fell in the charge and pursuit,
and ten pieces of cannon, with eleven tumbrils
filled with ammunition, were captured,
exclusive of those taken by the remainder of the
army. A writer who was present at this engagement
(Robert Brown of the Coldstream guards),
states in his Journal, published in 1795, "<em>the</em>
<span class="smcap">Seventh</span> <em>and Eleventh light dragoons performed prodigies
of valour on our left</em>." The Duke of York
observed in general orders, after complimenting
several other corps, "<em>Nor is the determined gallantry
with which the</em> <span class="smcap">Seventh</span> <em>and Eleventh light
dragoons attacked the enemy on the left (notwithstanding
their numbers), less worthy of every commendation</em>."
The loss of the regiment on this
occasion was one man and seven horses killed,
nineteen men and six horses wounded.</p>

<p>After the fall of Landrécies, the regiment
proceeded by forced marches to the vicinity of
<em>Tournay</em>; and on the 10th of May, when the
French attacked the British position with thirty
thousand men, it had another opportunity of sig<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>nalizing
itself. The enemy having failed in his
attempt to turn the British left, directed his
efforts against the centre. A favourable opportunity
presenting itself, sixteen British and two
Austrian squadrons were detached, under Lieut.-General
Harcourt, against the enemy's right, and
by a determined charge broke the French
columns. A second charge proved decisive; the
French were defeated, and the British troops
were thanked in general orders for their excellent
conduct. The <span class="smcap">Seventh</span> had six horses killed;
four men and four horses wounded; and two
horses missing.</p>

<p>A general attack having been resolved upon,
with the view of compelling the French to evacuate
Flanders, the <span class="smcap">Queen's Own</span> light dragoons
were selected to take part in this enterprise, and
were attached to one of the columns, under His
Royal Highness the Duke of York, which advanced
at an early hour on the morning of the
17th of May, to the vicinity of Lannoy, where the
troops halted a short period, until a thick fog
cleared off, when they resumed their march.
Arriving at <em>Roubaix</em>, the place was gallantly
captured, and the troops reposed a few hours in
the town. As the sun was declining in the western
horizon, and the shades of evening were gathering
over the provinces of Flanders, Lieut.-General
Abercromby received orders to attack a village two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
miles distant, called <em>Mouvaux</em>, which was situated
on a rising ground, surrounded by palisades and
entrenchments, protected by flanking redoubts,
and defended by a strong body of republican
troops. This enterprise was undertaken with
cheerful alacrity; the flank battalion of the foot
guards stormed the works, and the <span class="smcap">Seventh</span>
light dragoons, led by Lieut.-Colonel William
Osborne, (a most gallant officer, who had been
twenty years in the regiment<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>), made a detour
round the village, followed by the Fifteenth light
dragoons, under Lieut.-Colonel Churchill. As
the French soldiers began to give way before the
furious onset of the foot guards, and issuing from
among the houses, attempted to escape by the
rear of the village, they were charged by the two
cavalry regiments with the most distinguished
bravery. The <span class="smcap">Seventh</span> were in front on this
occasion; arriving at a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chevaux-de-frise</i>, a few
men of the regiment dismounted, and, though
exposed to a sharp fire of musketry, cleared a
space for the troops to pass, when the two regiments
rushed with terrific violence upon the
French infantry, broke their ranks, and cut them
down with a dreadful slaughter, capturing three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>guns. When the two regiments returned from
the pursuit, the evening was far advanced, and
they passed the night in the village.</p>

<p>The Austrians having failed in several of their
points of attack, the enemy was enabled to bring
nearly his whole force against the daring Britons
who had thus attacked his position; and the
morning of the 18th of May was ushered in by a
tremendous cannonade. Multitudes of French
cavalry, infantry, and artillery, appeared advancing
in every direction; and by nine o'clock, Lieut.-General
Abercromby found the few men he had
with him nearly surrounded by crowds of opponents;
at the same time he received orders from
the Duke of York to retire to the heights behind
Roubaix. He fell back fighting; and as he passed
through the town, his rear was pressed by hosts of
enemies, who followed, shouting and assailing the
British with grape and musketry. From Roubaix
the division proceeded towards Lannoy; being
beset by superior numbers, the soldiers had to
dispute every foot of ground, and to keep up a
running fight. The <span class="smcap">Seventh</span> and Fifteenth light
dragoons were constantly engaged on the flanks
and in the rear. <em>Lannoy</em> being found occupied
by the French, the British division took to the
fields, passing over hedges and ditches, constantly
fighting crowds of opponents, the light cavalry
evincing the most noble ardour and intrepidity;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
and the <span class="smcap">Seventh</span> thus exhibiting, under accumulated
disasters and difficulties, the innate bravery
of Britons, and the great value of light cavalry.
One of the foot guards who was present (Browne),
observes in his Journal, "Our British light cavalry
which were with us (the Seventh, Fifteenth, and
Sixteenth) performed wonders of valour, charging
the enemy with unexampled courage whenever
they approached; it was no uncommon thing
to see <em>one</em> of them attack <em>three</em> of the French
dragoons at once, in order to rescue the prisoners
they were carrying off. It was owing to
their bravery that so few prisoners were taken;
they also retook numbers from the enemy. As
soon as we reached the village of Templeuve,
we halted and formed; and from thence
marched to our former position, behind the village
of Blandin. Our loss proved to be very inconsiderable
to what might have been expected,
for it was rather to be wondered at that one of
us escaped." The loss of the <span class="smcap">Seventh</span> was, four
horses killed; six men and ten horses wounded;
and fifteen men and thirty-two horses prisoners of
war and missing. The conduct of the British on
this trying occasion was highly commended by the
Emperor of Germany; and the Duke of York
expressed his approbation of the valour and firmness
of the corps engaged.</p>

<p>The troops returned to their former position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
in front of <em>Tournay</em>, where the British were
attacked on the 22nd of May; they repulsed
their opponents, who were forced to retire with
the loss of seven pieces of artillery. The loss of
the <span class="smcap">Seventh</span> on this occasion was limited to one
troop horse.</p>

<p>The immense numbers which the enemy was
enabled to bring forward, at length forced the
allies to retreat from the Austrian Netherlands to
the United Provinces; and during this retrograde
movement the <span class="smcap">Seventh</span> were frequently engaged
in out-post duty, in covering the retiring army,
and in numerous rencounters with detachments
of French cavalry.</p>

<p>Tn August the army was encamped near <em>Breda</em>,
on a large plain bestrewed with the vestiges of
war, to give the Dutch an opportunity of putting
the fortress in a state of defence. While at this
camp, a piquet of the <span class="smcap">Seventh</span> and Sixteenth
light dragoons surprised one of the enemy's out-guards.
The French dragoons fled at the first
onset; and many of them forsook their horses to
escape across walls and other fences where mounted
troopers could not pursue them; seven men were,
however, made prisoners, and forty horses were
captured.</p>

<p>One hundred thousand French advanced to
attack thirty-five thousand British, and the Duke
of York made a further retrograde movement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
In October the army defended the passage of the
Waal from the island of Bommel until it communicated
with the Austrians on the left. The enemy
constructed batteries before <em>Nimeguen</em>; a sortie was
made on the 4th of November, in order to destroy
the French works, and the <span class="smcap">Queen's Own</span> light
dragoons formed part of the force employed on
this service. The infantry led on by Major-General
De Burgh (afterwards Earl of Clanricarde),
stormed the enemy's entrenchments in
gallant style, when a dreadful carnage ensued, the
French fighting with resolution, but the British
proved irresistible with the bayonet: as the
enemy fled from their works, the <span class="smcap">Seventh</span> and
other cavalry charged them in the rear and
cut them down with great slaughter. "Here"
(Captain Jones states in the Historical Journal)
"the British performed prodigies of valour": a
thousand opponents lay weltering on the plain
and among the works; the troops were thanked
in general orders for their services on this occasion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1795</div>

<p>At length a severe frost enabled the enemy
to advance in the beginning of 1795, across
the rivers on the ice, and the British, being no
longer capable of resisting the very superior
numbers of their opponents, retired through
Holland to Germany. During this retreat
the troops endured very great hardship and
privation from severe weather, and from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
hostile spirit manifested by the Dutch, who had
imbibed principles favourable to the French
interest. The <span class="smcap">Seventh</span> light dragoons were employed
in covering the retrograde movements, and
had occasional skirmishes with the enemy's leading
corps. After their arrival in Germany, they
occupied quarters of refreshment for several
weeks; during the summer they were encamped
on one of the plains of Westphalia; and in
November returned to England.</p>

<p>On the decease of General Sir Henry Clinton,
K.B., his Majesty conferred the colonelcy of the
regiment on Major-General David Dundas, by
commission dated the 26th of December, 1795.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1796<br />1797<br />1798<br />1799</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Queen's Own</span> light dragoons occupied
various quarters in England until the summer of
1799, when they were encamped near Windsor,
and were reviewed by the King, who was pleased
to express, in very gracious terms, his royal approbation
of their appearance and field movements.
In the mean time the British government had
resolved to make, in connection with the Russians,
an attempt to deliver Holland from the power
of the French republic; and the <span class="smcap">Seventh</span> embarked
for this service at Ramsgate, in the
beginning of September, under the command of
Lieut.-Colonel <span class="smcap">Henry Lord Paget</span>, who was
appointed to the command of the cavalry employed
in this expedition, consisting of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Seventh</span>, Eleventh, Fifteenth, and part of the
Eighteenth light dragoons; the whole being
under the orders of His Royal Highness the Duke
of York.</p>

<p>On the advance of the army on the 19th of
September, the <span class="smcap">Seventh</span> were attached to the
column under Lieut.-General de Hermann, which
attacked the enemy at half-past three in the
morning, and by eight gained possession of <em>Bergen</em>,
a large village surrounded by extensive woods;
but the Russians, overlooking the formidable
resistance they were to meet with, had not preserved
the necessary order, and they were driven
back with the loss of many men, and Lieut.-Generals
de Hermann and Tchertchekoff taken
prisoners.</p>

<p>In the attack of the enemy's position on the
2nd of October, the <span class="smcap">Seventh</span> formed part of the
cavalry attached to the column commanded by
Lieut.-General Sir Ralph Abercromby, which advanced
along the beach to within a mile of
<em>Egmont-op-Zee</em>, where a corps of French infantry
was posted among the sand-hills, with a numerous
body of cavalry and artillery on the beach. A
sanguinary contest ensued, in which the heroic
perseverance of the British was conspicuous.
Late in the evening the enemy's cavalry made an
attempt on the British horse artillery on the
beach: but were charged with signal intrepidity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
by the light dragoons under Colonel <span class="smcap">Lord Paget</span>,
and driven with considerable loss nearly to the
town. The British established themselves among
the sand-hills, where they passed the night, and
on the following day gained possession of Egmont-op-Zee<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>.
The <span class="smcap">Seventh</span> had two men and four
horses killed on this occasion, and eleven men
and twenty-five horses wounded.</p>

<p>Part of the regiment was engaged on the
6th of October, in driving the enemy from his
position between <em>Beverwyck</em> and <em>Wyck-op-Zee</em>,
which proved a sanguinary service; but the
<span class="smcap">Seventh</span> did not sustain any loss.</p>

<p>These gallant efforts were not seconded by the
Dutch, and severe weather, with other causes,
having rendered a retreat necessary, the <span class="smcap">Seventh</span>
under <span class="smcap">Lord Paget</span>, covered the movement. Some
skirmishing took place, and several pieces of cannon
fell into the hands of the enemy, when his
lordship led one squadron on to the charge
with signal gallantry, and breaking in upon and
repulsing a force six times more numerous than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>his own, retook the cannon and with them
several pieces belonging to the enemy.</p>

<p>Circumstances having occurred to induce the
Duke of York to vacate Holland, the regiment
returned to England in December, and was stationed
at Canterbury.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1800<br />1801</div>

<p>In the year 1800 the <span class="smcap">Queen's Own</span> light
dragoons were stationed at Windsor and Hounslow,
to perform the escort duty for the royal
family; in 1801 they were quartered at Reading,
with detached troops in Sussex, from whence
they were removed to Oxfordshire and Wiltshire.</p>

<p>Lieut.-General Sir David Dundas was removed
to the Scots Greys in May, 1801, and the lieut.-colonel
of the <span class="smcap">Seventh</span>, Colonel <span class="smcap">Henry W. Lord
Paget</span> (now <span class="smcap">Marquis of Anglesey</span>), was advanced
by King George III. to the colonelcy of
the regiment, as a special mark of royal favour
and approbation for his personal merit, and for
the excellent state of discipline and efficiency
manifested on all occasions by the corps under
his orders.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1802<br />1803</div>

<p>Peace having been concluded with the French
republic, in 1802, the establishment of the regiment
was reduced; but in 1803, the treacherous
conduct of Napoleon Bonaparte gave rise to
another war, and the establishment was again
augmented. When Bonaparte made his ostentatious,
but vain, preparations for the invasion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Great Britain, the <span class="smcap">Seventh</span> were stationed at
Ipswich and Norwich, and were held in readiness
to repel the invaders, should they venture to
approach the shores of Britain.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1804</div>

<p>In 1804 the establishment was augmented to
ten troops.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1805<br />1807</div>

<p>In 1805 directions were received for the light
dragoon appointments and clothing to be changed
for those of <span class="smcap">Hussars</span>; the alteration took place
on the 25th of December, 1807; and the regiment
subsequently obtained the designation of
"<span class="smcap">Seventh, or Queen's Own, Regiment of
Hussars</span>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">1808</div>

<p>After passing six years at Ipswich and Norwich,
the <span class="smcap">Seventh Hussars</span> proceeded to Guildford
in July, 1808; and when on their march
they were reviewed by His Royal Highness the
Duke of York, on Hounslow-heath. Important
events had, in the mean time, transpired on the
continent and in the peninsula, and Portugal and
Spain had become subject to the tyrannical sway
of Bonaparte, who had nearly attained the
zenith of his power. Portugal was delivered
during the summer of 1808, by British skill and
valour; and a powerful effort in aid of the
Spaniards, who were endeavouring to free themselves
of the French yoke, having been resolved
upon by the British government, the <span class="smcap">Seventh
Hussars</span> were selected to take part in this enterprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>Eight troops, commanded by Lieut.-Colonel
R. H. Vivian, and consisting of two lieut.-colonels
(Vivian and Kerrison), two majors (Hon. Berkeley
Paget and Hon. G. H. C. Cavendish), eight captains,
six lieutenants, four cornets, four staff-officers, six
quarter-masters, 717 non-commissioned officers,
trumpeters, and privates, and 677 troop-horses,
embarked at Portsmouth in October; on arriving
at Corunna, in November, the horses were slung
overboard, and they swam to the shore. The
regiment marched by squadrons to Astorga, from
whence it proceeded, with the Tenth and Fifteenth
hussars, towards Salamanca, to join the
troops advancing from Portugal under Lieut.-General
Sir John Moore, K.B. The British commander
had been promised that his advance
should be covered by a powerful and victorious
Spanish army, and that numerous and enthusiastic
legions of patriots were ready to co-operate
with him; but not a Spanish soldier was in his
front;&mdash;the enemy was at hand;&mdash;those armies
with which he had been ordered to co-operate
had been routed and dispersed, and Bonaparte
was approaching the capital of Spain in triumph.
Twenty-three thousand Britons were not able to
cope with three hundred thousand French; but
Sir John Moore resolved to push boldly forward,
and menace the French lines, that he might thus
draw Bonaparte with a powerful army from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
capital, which would give time for the southern
provinces of Spain to organize their means of resistance,
and for the discomfited Spanish armies
to re-assemble. The boldness and ability with
which this resolution was executed, surprised
Napoleon, and deserve the commendation of posterity.
The <span class="smcap">Seventh Hussars</span> were employed in
this enterprise, and a piquet of the regiment was
engaged on the 21st of December, with the Tenth
and Fifteenth hussars, commanded by Lieut.-General
<span class="smcap">Lord Paget</span>, in driving a body of French
dragoons from <em>Sahagun</em>, when about twenty of
the enemy were killed, and thirteen officers and
one hundred and fifty-four men taken prisoners,
in a sharp sword-fight which lasted about twenty
minutes.</p>

<p>The approach of Bonaparte with an immense
army rendered it necessary for the British
to withdraw, and the heavy baggage, with several
brigades of infantry, commenced retiring; at the
same time the cavalry patroles advanced up to
the French lines and skirmished, to conceal the
retrograde movement. On the morning of the
25th of December a squadron of the <span class="smcap">Seventh
Hussars</span>, commanded by Lieut.-Colonel Kerrison,
advanced towards <em>Carrion</em>, and encountering a
French detachment of about equal numbers,
made them all prisoners except the officer, who
wounded Lieut.-Colonel Kerrison in the arm, and
escaped.</p>

    <div class="chapter"></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>The regiment commenced its retreat a few
hours after this affair; and the army rested two
days at <em>Benevente</em>, a rich open town situate in a
plain extending from the Gallician mountains to
the neighbourhood of Burgos. The infantry afterwards
continued the retreat, while the cavalry
remained in the town, and had parties watching
the fords of the little river Esla. Soon after day-break
on the 29th of December, six hundred
cavalry of the French imperial guard crossed the
stream and advanced into the plain; the British
detachments retired fighting, and a piquet of the
<span class="smcap">Seventh Hussars</span>, under Lieutenant Lowther,
was sharply engaged. Being joined by part of
the Third German hussars, the piquets charged
the French leading squadrons with signal gallantry,
the ground was obstinately disputed, and a particularly
animating scene presented itself. Baggage
mules and followers of the army were scattered
over the plain, the town was filled with
tumult, the distant piquets and videts were galloping
in from right and left; the French were
pressing forward, and every appearance indicated
that the enemy's whole army was come up and
passing the river. Suddenly <span class="smcap">Lord Paget</span> led
the Tenth hussars at speed into the plain; the
piquets that were engaged united, and the whole
charged. In an instant the scene changed, the
French were seen galloping back, with the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
at their heels; they plunged into the stream without
breaking their ranks, and having gained the
opposite heights, they wheeled round and appeared
inclined to come forward a second time; but the
British horse artillery opening upon them, they
retired. Fifty-five killed and wounded Frenchmen
lay on the plain, their general, Lefebre Desnouettes,
and several other officers, were taken prisoners,
and many of those who escaped across the river,
were wounded. The piquet of the <span class="smcap">Seventh
Hussars</span> suffered severely, nearly every man
being either killed or wounded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1809<br />1810</div>

<p>The enemy planted heavy cannon on the bank
of the river, and made a show of re-crossing; but
<span class="smcap">Lord Paget</span> guarded the fords all the day, and at
night withdrew with the cavalry. The <span class="smcap">Seventh</span>
were constantly in the rear of the army, with
the other hussar regiments, during the remainder
of the retreat; they, however, suffered little
from the swords of the enemy; but the effects of
frost, snow, and of a deficiency in the supplies of
provision and forage, were severely felt. The
want of horse-shoes was a serious evil, which was
owing to the impracticability of the forge carts
accompanying the regiment. When the army
withdrew from the position at Lugo, during the
night of the 8th of January, 1809, the <span class="smcap">Seventh
Hussars</span> were left behind to keep up the bivouac
fires, and to cover the retreat, and they were in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
the rear of the army until it arrived within three
leagues of Corunna.</p>

<p>On arriving at Corunna, the regiment mounted
two hundred and fifty horses only, out of six
hundred and eighty which had marched from
that port about two months before, and many of
those which remained, were destroyed for the
want of transport, which could be obtained only
for the officers' horses and for about ninety troop-horses.</p>

<p>The French were defeated in a general action
fought on the 16th of January, when <span class="smcap">Sir John
Moore</span> fell mortally wounded. The army afterwards
embarked and returned to England. Thus
the British had intercepted the blow which was
descending to crush Spain; time had been given
to enable the patriots to re-organize their armies;
and Bonaparte being recalled to France, by the
news that Austria and Russia were arming to
oppose him, the war was protracted in Spain. On
the passage to England the Despatch transport,
having on board Major the Hon. G. C. Cavendish,
Captain G. Dukinfield, and Lieutenant the Hon.
Edward Waldegrave, with one hundred and thirteen
men, and forty-four horses, was wrecked near
the Lizard, on the coast of Cornwall, and only
seven men escaped.</p>

<p>After its arrival from Spain, the regiment was
quartered at Guildford, from whence it proceeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
to Weymouth; in May, 1810, it embarked at
Liverpool for Ireland, and was stationed at
Dublin, with detached troops at Athy and Carlow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1811<br />1812<br />1813</div>

<p>In 1811 the head-quarters were removed to
Dundalk, where they remained during the year
1812; and in 1813 the regiment embarked at
Dublin for England.</p>

<p>Having landed at Liverpool, the regiment
proceeded to London; it was stationed at Hyde
Park barracks, Hampton Court, and Hounslow,
and performed the king's duty during the absence
of the household cavalry on foreign service.</p>

<p>The glorious victories gained by the allied
army under Field Marshal the Marquis of Wellington
had, in the mean time, accomplished the
deliverance of Portugal, and of nearly all Spain,
from the despotic sway of Bonaparte, and the
<span class="smcap">Seventh Hussars</span> were selected to take part in
completing the overthrow of the tyrannical power
of Napoleon. Eight troops, commanded by Lieut.-Colonel
R. Hussey Vivian, embarked at Portsmouth
on the 15th of August, and landed at
Bilboa, the capital of Biscay, in Spain, on the
1st of September; and two additional troops
joined from England in October. The regiment
was formed in brigade with the Tenth and Fifteenth
hussars, commanded by Major-General
Lord Edward Somerset.</p>

<p>After the surrender of the castle of St. Sebas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>tian
the regiment advanced, and having joined
the army, supported the infantry at the passage
of the <em>Bidassoa</em>, and advanced as far as Vera on
the borders of France. The <span class="smcap">Seventh Hussars</span>
subsequently retired through the Pyrenean mountains
to the vicinity of Pampeluna, which fortress
surrendered on the 31st of October.</p>

<p>Colonel Richard Hussey Vivian having been
appointed to the command of a brigade of cavalry,
the command of the regiment devolved on Lieut.-Colonel
Edward Kerrison.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1814</div>

<p>After occupying village cantonments near
Pampeluna for several weeks, the <span class="smcap">Seventh Hussars</span>
marched through the Pyrenees and joined
the army in France. On the 18th of December
they took the out-post duty at Cambo, a town
eight miles from Bayonne, where the French
army, under Marshal Soult, lay in a fortified
camp. On the 31st of December, the regiment
took the out-post duty on the road leading to St.
Jean Pied de Port, where a French division was
stationed. The weather becoming very severe,
the regiment went into cantonments in the beginning
of 1814, near Hasparan, in Gascony,
thirteen miles from Bayonne: in these quarters
forage was particularly scarce, and the horses
suffered in condition from being fed on chopped
gorse and about three pounds of oats a day. The
foraging parties sent towards the French lines,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
had frequent skirmishes, and on one of these
occasions, Captain Peter Augustus Heyliger was
wounded.</p>

<p>The weather having become more clear, the
army advanced in the middle of February, and on
the 24th the hussar brigade proceeded to the bank
of the Gave d'Oléron, in the expectation of being
engaged. Captain Fraser and twelve men of the
<span class="smcap">Seventh</span> passed the river under a heavy fire, and
were followed by Captain Verner's squadron, for
the purpose of supporting a body of infantry
which had crossed the stream and were seriously
engaged; but the enemy being in force, and the
ground such that cavalry could not act, the
squadron was re-called. The enemy abandoning
his position, the regiment crossed the river in
pursuit, and halted at the village of Boren.</p>

<p>Marshal Soult concentrated his forces behind
the Pau at <em>Orthes</em>; the allies advanced to attack
him; and the <span class="smcap">Seventh Hussars</span>, having crossed
the river, were engaged in driving the enemy from
his position on the 27th of February. About
10 o'clock the regiment was ordered to cover the
sixth division and the guns; and when the French
gave way, it dashed forward in pursuit, and by a
brilliant charge it overthrew a body of opponents,
and took sixty prisoners: this occurred about
3 o'clock. Shortly afterwards the regiment was
again ordered to charge, and being led forward by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Colonel Kerrison with signal gallantry, it was
once more successful, and sixteen officers, with
about seven hundred men, were made prisoners.
The Marquis of Wellington observed in his public
despatch: "Lieutenant-General Sir Stapleton
Cotton took advantage of the only opportunity
which occurred, to charge with Major-General
Lord Edward Somerset's brigade in the neighbourhood
of <em>Sault de Navailles</em>, where the enemy
had been driven from the high road by Lieutenant-General
Sir Rowland Hill. <em>The</em> <span class="smcap">Seventh
Hussars</span> <em>distinguished themselves upon this occasion,
and made many prisoners</em>."</p>

<p>The regiment had four men and five horses
killed; Major William Thornhill, Captain P. A.
Heyliger, Lieutenant Robert Douglas, nine men,
and eleven horses wounded.</p>

<p>After the battle of Orthes the <span class="smcap">Seventh Hussars</span>
were employed a short time at Villeneuve de
Marsan, in the department of the Landes; also at
Roquefort and Captieux, in protecting the rear of
the army from the depredations of parties of brigands.
From these quarters the regiment advanced,
and rejoining the army near <em>Toulouse</em>,
supported the infantry in the action at that place
on the 10th of April.</p>

<p>When the French withdrew from Toulouse, the
regiment moved forward and was employed in the
out-post duty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>At length hostilities were terminated by the
abdication of Bonaparte and the restoration of
the Bourbon dynasty. Thus a war of unprincipled
aggression, begun in acts of fraud and perfidy, and
carried on with treachery, cruelty, and rapine,
ended with the downfall of its author, and the
humiliation and dispersion of his boasted invincible
legions.</p>

<p>After the termination of hostilities, the regiment
reposed a month in village cantonments;
and on the 1st of June commenced its march for
Boulogne, where it embarked for England, and,
after landing, it marched to Romford, and in
September to Brighton. Its services were subsequently
rewarded with the honour of bearing the
word "<span class="smcap">Peninsula</span>" upon its appointments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1815</div>

<p>Riots having occurred in London towards the
end of February and in the beginning of March,
1815, in consequence of the introduction into
Parliament of a bill to regulate the importation
of grain, the <span class="smcap">Seventh Hussars</span> were suddenly
ordered to proceed thither from Brighton.</p>

<p>The return of Bonaparte to France, the sudden
defection of the forces of Louis XVIII., and the
elevation of the usurper to the throne, filled
Europe with astonishment. War was resolved
upon, and on the 25th of March three squadrons
of the <span class="smcap">Queen's Own Hussars</span>, commanded by
Col. Sir Edward Kerrison, marched from London<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
for foreign service; they embarked at Dover,
landed at Ostend, and, after marching a few stages
up the country, went into cantonments, and were
formed in brigade with the Fifteenth hussars, and
Second hussars of the King's German legion,
under the orders of Major-General Sir Colquhoun
Grant, K.C.B. On the 29th of May they were
reviewed, with other brigades of the cavalry, by
Field-Marshal his Grace the Duke of Wellington,
accompanied by Marshal Von Blucher, the commander
of the Prussian army.</p>

<p>Bonaparte, endeavouring, by one of those rapid
movements for which he had been so famous, to
interpose between the British and Prussian armies,
and beat them in detail, suddenly attacked and
drove in the out-posts, and early on the morning
of the 16th of June the <span class="smcap">Seventh Hussars</span> advanced
to support the troops engaged at <em>Quatre
Bras</em>. After a march of many miles, they arrived
at the scene of conflict; the French were repulsed,
and the troops bivouacked in the fields.</p>

<p>The Prussians having been defeated and forced
to retreat, the Duke of Wellington made a corresponding
movement on the 17th of June, to
preserve his communication with them, and the
<span class="smcap">Seventh Hussars</span> were engaged, with other corps,
in covering this retrograde movement. On passing
through the village of <em>Genappe</em>, the French
lancers began to press upon the rear of the retiring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
army, and the <span class="smcap">Seventh</span> were directed by their
colonel, Lieutenant-General the Earl of Uxbridge,
to charge. This order was executed with signal
bravery; but the lancers, being sustained by a
great mass of cavalry, and having their flanks
secure, presented an almost impenetrable row of
pikes, through which the hussars were unable to
break. The regiment rallied and charged a
second time; but the lancers, being well supported
and advantageously posted, were enabled
to maintain their ground. Some impression had,
however, been made, and two squadrons of the
first regiment of life guards coming up at speed,
the weight and power of their charge broke the
lancers, who were pursued through the village
with great slaughter. The retreat was afterwards
continued with skirmishing and cannonading to
the position in front of the village of <em>Waterloo</em>,
where the army passed the night exposed to a
heavy rain.</p>

<p>On the following day the hard contested and
sanguinary battle of <em>Waterloo</em> was fought,&mdash;a
battle memorable in the annals of Europe,&mdash;where
the fate of empires was decided by the sword, and
the British troops acquired immortal honour!
During the early part of the action the <span class="smcap">Seventh
Hussars</span> supported the infantry, and towards
the evening they were ordered forward. Moving
from Hugomont, they acted nearly on the reverse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
of the enemy, and by a series of brilliant charges,
most nobly executed, contributed to the final
overthrow of the French army. On this occasion
the officers and men proved their resolution to
support the high character which the regiment
had so long borne; and their conduct was publicly
noticed and attested in the strongest and most
unequivocal terms by the commander of the
cavalry, Lieutenant-General the Earl of Uxbridge,
who, after having gone through this arduous day,
received a wound at the close of the action by
which he lost his right leg.</p>

<p>The loss of the regiment on the 17th and 18th
of June was, one serjeant, fifty-five rank and file,
and eighty-four horses killed; Captains J. W.
Robins, W. Vernor, and P. A. Heyliger; Lieutenants
R. Douglas, E. Peters, and R. Beattie;
with nine serjeants, one trumpeter, eighty-three
rank and file, and one hundred and sixteen horses
wounded.</p>

<p>The gallant conduct of the regiment on this
occasion, was subsequently rewarded with the
honour of bearing the word "<span class="smcap">Waterloo</span>" on its
appointments; the officers and men received each
a silver medal; and the privilege of reckoning
two years' service for that day, was conferred on
the subaltern officers, and also on the non-commissioned
officers and private men.</p>

<p>On the 19th of June, the regiment advanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
in pursuit of the French, who fled in dismay
towards Paris; on the evening of the 24th, it was
at the capture of <em>Cambray</em> by escalade, by Lieut.-General
Sir Charles Colville's division. On arriving
at the vicinity of Paris, the war was
terminated, by the surrender of the capital, and
the restoration of Louis XVIII. to the throne of
his ancestors.</p>

<p>After occupying village cantonments near
Paris for several months, and taking part in
several grand reviews, at which the Emperors of
Russia and Austria, and the Kings of Prussia
and France, were present, the <span class="smcap">Seventh Hussars</span>
were selected to form part of the army of occupation
in France, and they proceeded to Estaples
and neighbouring villages.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1816</div>

<p>In the summer of 1816, the <span class="smcap">Seventh</span> marched
to quarters between St. Omer and Dunkirk, for
the purpose of field exercise and review, and
were joined by a squadron from England. On
the 22nd of October, the Duke of Wellington
reviewed the army on the plains of St. Denain,
and witnessed the troops go through the formula
of a mock engagement. The <span class="smcap">Seventh</span> afterwards
returned to their former quarters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1817</div>

<p>In February, 1817, the regiment was again
quartered near St. Omer, for the convenience of
field exercise; it was subsequently stationed
between Cambray and Valenciennes, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
again reviewed in October, by the Duke of
Wellington, together with the remainder of British
troops, and the Saxons, Danes, and Hanoverians.
The regiment was afterwards stationed at Cassel
and adjacent villages.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1818</div>

<p>Several changes of quarters took place in
1818; and the regiment was at the grand military
spectacles, when the army was seen by their
Royal Highnesses the Dukes of Kent and Cumberland,
and when the Russians, British, Saxons,
Danes, and Hanoverians were reviewed, by the
Emperor of Russia, King of Prussia, Prince of
Orange, Grand Dukes Constantine and Michael,
&amp;c., &amp;c. After these reviews, the army of occupation
quitted France: the <span class="smcap">Seventh Hussars</span>
embarked at Calais, landed at Dover and Ramsgate,
and marched to Chertsey, &amp;c.</p>

<p>On the night of the 1st of December the
regiment attended the funeral of Her Majesty
Queen Charlotte.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1819<br />1820</div>

<p>In 1819, the regiment marched to Scotland;
in August, 1820, it embarked at Port Patrick for
Ireland; and the head-quarters were stationed
twelve months at Dundalk.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1821</div>

<p>In August, 1821, the regiment marched to
Dublin, on the occasion of the visit of His
Majesty King George IV. to the capital of
Ireland. On the 18th of August, the king reviewed
the <span class="smcap">Seventh Hussars</span>, with the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
troops in garrison at Dublin, on which occasion
the regiment was commanded by its colonel, the
Marquis of Anglesey. In September the establishment
was reduced from eight to six troops.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1822<br />1823</div>

<p>Leaving Dublin in December, 1822, the regiment
proceeded to Newbridge; in June, 1823, it
embarked at Waterford, and landing at Bristol,
proceeded to Richmond and other villages in the
neighbourhood of Hounslow.</p>

<p>On the 15th of July the two regiments of life
guards, Blues, Third light dragoons, and <span class="smcap">Seventh</span>
and Fifteenth hussars, with a brigade of horse
artillery, were reviewed on Hounslow-heath by
his Royal Highness the Duke of York.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1824</div>

<p>After the review the <span class="smcap">Seventh Hussars</span> marched
to Brighton, Chichester, and Hastings, with detachments
on revenue duty on the coast; but
returned to the vicinity of Hounslow in the spring
of 1824, the head-quarters being at Hampton
Court; and on the 7th of July they were again
reviewed, with the same corps as in the preceding
year, on Hounslow-heath, by the Duke of York.
The head-quarters were afterwards removed to
Hounslow barracks, and the regiment took the
escort duty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1825<br />1826<br />1827</div>

<p>In July, 1825, the regiment proceeded to York,
Beverley, and Newcastle; in April, 1826, it
marched to Scotland, and was stationed at Edinburgh
and Perth, with parties on revenue duty at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Cupar, Angus, and Forfar; and in March, 1827,
it left Scotland for the South of England.</p>

<p>On the 12th of April the <span class="smcap">Seventh Hussars</span>
were reviewed on Hounslow-heath by his Grace
the Duke of Wellington, who was pleased to
express his unqualified approbation of their appearance
and discipline. After the review they
continued their march to Brighton and Chichester.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1828<br />1829<br />1830</div>

<p>Leaving these quarters, the regiment proceeded
to Liverpool in March, 1828, and embarking for
Ireland, landed at Dublin, where it was stationed
until May, 1829, when it was removed to Newbridge,
and in May, 1830, to Dundalk, Monaghan,
and Belturbet.</p>

<p>On the 2d of August, 1830, a general order was
issued for the whole of the cavalry, with the
exception of the Royal Horse Guards (Blues), to be
dressed in <em>red</em>; the <span class="smcap">Seventh Hussars</span> were consequently
furnished with red pelisses in the
following year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1831</div>

<p>The regiment left Dundalk, &amp;c., in April, 1831,
for Newbridge, and in June proceeded to Dublin
and embarked for England. After landing at
Liverpool, it marched to Birmingham, with detached
troops at Coventry and Kidderminster.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1832<br />1833<br />1834</div>

<p>In March, 1832, the regiment proceeded to
Norwich, Ipswich, and one troop to Boston. In
the month of March of the following year it
proceeded to Scotland, and was stationed at Hamilton
and Glasgow, and in February, 1834, per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>formed
much extra duty in consequence of riots
among the cotton spinners and calico printers in
the neighbourhood of Glasgow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1835</div>

<p>On the 2d of May, 1834, the regiment left its
quarters in Scotland, and proceeding to England,
was stationed at York and Newcastle; and in
April, 1835, it marched to Nottingham, Sheffield,
Derby, and Boston.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1836<br />1837</div>

<p>In April, 1836, the regiment proceeded to
Hounslow, and took the escort duty. In June,
1837, it embarked at Bristol for Ireland, landed
at Cork, and the head-quarters were established
at Ballincollig, from whence they were removed
in August to Cork, and in September to Dublin,
where they passed the winter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1838<br />1839</div>

<p>Orders having been received for the regiment
to transfer its services to Canada, it was divided
into four service and two depôt troops; the service
troops embarked at Cork on the 1st of May,
1838; and arrived at Montreal in June. In November,
1838, they were employed against the
insurgents in Lower Canada, and one troop was
similarly employed in January, 1839.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1840<br />1841<br />1842</div>

<p>During the years 1839, 1840, and 1841, the
service troops were stationed at Montreal and
Laprairie. In the year 1841 orders were received
to resume blue pelisses. The Service Troops have
continued in Canada to the summer of 1842,
the date of the conclusion of this memoir.</p>

<p class="p2" />
<p>The record of the services of the <span class="smcap">Seventh</span>, or
<span class="smcap">Queen's Own Hussars</span>, for a period of one hundred
and fifty years, (as contained in the preceding
pages,) exhibits a proof, among the other portions
of the British army, of attachment to their officers,
of loyalty and fidelity to their sovereign, and
of zeal and devotedness to their country. On all
occasions, when their services have been required
to meet a foreign enemy, they have entered upon
the difficulties of active warfare with readiness
and a determination to perform the duties allotted
them; and their bravery and contempt of danger
have been strongly evinced. Their gallantry at
the battle of Dettingen in 1743; their conduct at
<em>Warbourg</em> in 1760, under the Marquis of Granby,
and on other occasions in Germany during the
Seven years' War;&mdash;their boldness and intrepid
bearing in conflict with the enemy at <em>Cateau</em>,
<em>Roubaix</em>, <em>Tournay</em>, and <em>Mouvaux</em>, under the Duke
of York, in 1794, which received His Royal
Highness's strongest commendations, afford instances
of the most determined bravery.</p>

<p>The proofs of true courage were further adduced
by the firm conduct of the <span class="smcap">Seventh Hussars</span> in
the advance into Spain under Lieut.-General Sir
John Moore in 1808, and in the retreat to Corunna
in January, 1809, as detailed in the Regimental
Record. The gallantry of the regiment at the
battle of Waterloo, in June, 1815, gained an
imperishable addition to its fame; and the deeds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
of the officers and men, who fought on that
glorious occasion, are sufficient to perpetuate an
emulous desire in the present and future members
of the corps to rival the exertions of their brave
predecessors.</p>

<p>The smart, active, and soldier-like appearance
of the regiment, its correct and orderly conduct
in quarters, and its gallantry in the field, have
acquired a high character in the estimation of the
country, and proved it to be a valuable acquisition
to the crown and to the government.</p>

<p>In thus recording the commendations due to
so distinguished a regiment as the <span class="smcap">Seventh</span> Hussars,
the compiler of this Record, with true
respect towards the gallant officer and nobleman
at the head of the corps, ventures to associate his
fame and honour with those of his regiment, with
which, for more than forty years, they have been
identified: General the Marquis of Anglesey,
K.G. and G.C.B., assumed the command of the
<span class="smcap">Seventh</span> Hussars as Lieutenant-Colonel on the
6th of April, 1797; he shared with his regiment in
the dangers and honours of the conflicts in Holland
in 1799; at Sahagun and Benevente in 1808; in
the retreat to Corunna in 1809; and at the all-crowning
victory of Waterloo in 1815, where
he lost his leg by a cannon shot. In future ages
the gallant and heroic deeds of this nobleman
will be the admiration of every member and
friend of the British army.</p>

<p class="center smcap">Robert Cunningham.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 30th December, 1690.</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert Cunningham</span> was an officer of reputation
in the Scots brigade in the service of Holland, and was
wounded at the battle of St. Denis, in 1678. Proceeding
to Scotland, he became a warm advocate for the
principles of the Revolution of 1688, and having performed
faithful services in that cause, he was rewarded
with the colonelcy of a regiment of foot formed during
the winter of 1689-90. When the clans tendered their
submission to King William's government, Colonel
Cunningham's regiment was disbanded, and he obtained
the command of a corps of dragoons, now the
<span class="smcap">Seventh Hussars</span>. He served with his regiment,
under King William, in the Netherlands, during the
campaigns of 1694, 1695, and 1696, and in the summer
of the last-mentioned year he commanded a brigade of
dragoons in Flanders. At the close of the campaign
he was succeeded in the colonelcy by Lord Jedburgh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>


<p class="p2 center smcap">William, Lord Jedburgh.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 1st October, 1696.</em></p>

<p>The Honorable <span class="smcap">William Kerr</span>, son of Robert,
fourth Earl and first Marquis of Lothian, steadily supported
the principles of the Revolution, and rose to the
rank of colonel in the army on the 1st of March, 1692.
He succeeded, in the same year, to the title of <span class="smcap">Lord
Jedburgh</span>; and on the 1st of October, 1696, King
William appointed him to the colonelcy of a regiment
of dragoons, now the <span class="smcap">Seventh Hussars</span>. In 1702,
Queen Anne promoted him to the rank of brigadier-general.
On the decease of his father, in 1703, he succeeded
to the title of <span class="smcap">Marquis of Lothian</span><a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>. The
rank of major-general was conferred on his lordship in
1704; in the succeeding year he was invested with the
order of the Thistle; and in January, 1707, he obtained
the rank of lieut.-general. On the 25th of April following
he obtained the colonelcy of the third foot
guards, from which he was removed in 1713, in consequence
of his political views not being in accordance
with those of Queen Anne's new ministry. After the
accession of King George I., his lordship was appointed
to the staff of North Britain. He died in 1722.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 center smcap">Patrick, Lord Polwarth.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 28th April, 1707.</em></p>

<p>This officer was the son of Sir Patrick Hume, of
Polwarth, who was one of the most conspicuous and
vigorous characters of the age in which he lived, was a
strenuous opposer of the proceedings of King Charles II.
in Scotland, and was created, by King William, Lord
Polwarth, and Earl of Marchmont.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patrick Hume</span> was educated in Holland, and the
Prince of Orange gave him a commission in the Dutch
service. He accompanied His Highness to England at
the Revolution, and when his father was elevated to
the dignity of Earl of Marchmont, he was styled <span class="smcap">Lord
Polwarth</span>. He was appointed major of a regiment
of dragoons, now <span class="smcap">Seventh Hussars</span>, in 1694; lieut.-colonel
in 1697, and colonel in 1707. He died in 1709.</p>


<p class="p2 center smcap">The Honorable William Kerr.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 10th October, 1709.</em></p>

<p>The Honorable <span class="smcap">William Kerr</span>, third son of
Robert, Earl of Roxburgh, and brother of John, first
Duke of Roxburgh, served with reputation on the continent,
under the celebrated John, Duke of Marlborough.
In 1709 he was rewarded with the command of a regiment
of dragoons, now <span class="smcap">Seventh Hussars</span>, and on
the accession of King George I. he was appointed
groom of the bedchamber to the Prince of Wales. He
highly distinguished himself at the battle of Dumblain,
on the 13th of November, 1715, where, according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the accounts published at the time, he had three horses
killed under him, was wounded in the thigh, and had
his coat torn by a pistol bullet. The care and attention
which he paid to the interests of his corps, procured
him the affection and esteem of the officers and soldiers.
He was promoted to the rank of brigadier-general in
1727, to that of major-general in 1735, and to that of
lieut.-general in 1739. He died in 1741, after commanding
the regiment nearly thirty-two years.</p>


<p class="p2 center smcap">John Cope.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 12th August, 1741.</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Cope</span> entered the army in March, 1707, and
speedily rose to the lieut.-colonelcy in the second or
Scots troop of horse grenadier guards. He obtained the
rank of colonel in the army in 1711. In 1730 he was
promoted from the horse grenadier guards to the
colonelcy of the thirty-ninth foot, from which he was
removed to the fifth foot, in 1732. He was promoted
to the rank of brigadier-general in 1735; was removed
to the ninth dragoons in 1737; and advanced to the
rank of major-general two years afterwards. He served
several years on the staff of Ireland, obtained the
colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Seventh</span> dragoons in 1741, and proceeded,
in the summer of 1742, to Flanders with the
army commanded by Field-Marshal the Earl of Stair.
In the beginning of the following year he was promoted
to the rank of lieut.-general, and having signalized
himself, under the eye of his sovereign, at the head of
the second line of cavalry, at the battle of Dettingen,
he was constituted a knight of the Bath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir John Cope</span> was commander-in-chief in Scotland
when the rebellion of 1745 broke out in the Highlands,
and a small body of troops, under his immediate
command, was defeated by the clans under the young
Pretender, at Preston Pans, which unfortunate circumstance
enabled the rebels to penetrate into England.
He died in 1760.</p>


<p class="p2 center smcap">John Mostyn.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 18th August, 1760.</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Mostyn</span> served in the thirty-first foot, in
which corps he rose to the rank of captain, and in 1742
he was appointed captain-lieutenant in the second foot
guards. Having joined his company on foreign service,
he was engaged at the battle of Fontenoy, where the
foot guards highly distinguished themselves, and he was
wounded. In December, 1747, he was promoted to the
rank of colonel, and appointed aide-de-camp to King
George II.; and in 1751 he obtained the colonelcy of
the seventh foot, from which he was removed to the
thirteenth dragoons in 1754. In 1757 he was promoted
to the rank of major-general; he was removed to the
fifth dragoons in 1758, and to the <span class="smcap">Seventh</span> dragoons
in 1760. He commanded a brigade of infantry under
the Duke of Marlborough in the expedition to the coast
of France in 1758; in 1759 he was promoted to the
rank of lieut.-general, and serving in Germany under
Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick, he distinguished himself
on several occasions. At the conclusion of the war

promoted in 1772, to the rank of general. He died in
March, 1779.</p>

<p class="p2 center smcap">Sir George Howard, K.B.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 13th May, 1763.</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap">George Howard</span> entered the army in the reign of
King George I., and after serving the crown a period
of nineteen years, he obtained the lieut.-colonelcy of
the third foot on the 2nd of April, 1744. He commanded
the regiment at the battles of Fontenoy, Falkirk,
Culloden, and Val; and in 1749 he succeeded his
father in the colonelcy of the corps. He served with
distinction in Germany during the seven years' war;
was promoted to the rank of major-general in 1758, and
to that of lieut.-general in 1760: and at the conclusion
of the peace in 1763, he was removed to the <span class="smcap">Seventh</span>
dragoons, and advanced to the dignity of a knight of
the Bath. In 1777 he was promoted to the rank of
general; in April, 1779, he was removed to the first
dragoon guards; and was promoted to the rank of field-marshal
in October 1793; he was also a member of the
privy council, and governor of Jersey. He died on the
16th of July, 1796.</p>


<p class="p2 center smcap">Sir Henry Clinton, K.B.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 21st April, 1779.</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henry Clinton</span>, grandson of Francis, sixth Earl
of Lincoln, held a commission in an independent company
of foot at New York, from which he was removed
in 1751, to a lieutenancy in the second foot guards, and
in 1758 he was promoted to the rank of captain and
lieut.-colonel in the first foot guards. Having gained
great credit for his conduct during the seven years' war,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
in which the foot guards had several opportunities of
acquiring distinction, he was promoted, in 1762, to the
rank of colonel in the army; and in November, 1766,
King George III. rewarded him with the colonelcy of
the twelfth regiment of foot, then at Gibraltar; he was
promoted to the rank of major-general in 1772. On
the breaking out of hostilities in America, in 1775, this
distinguished officer was sent with reinforcements to
General Gage, at Boston, with the local rank of
lieut.-general, and signalized himself at the battle of
Bunker's Hill. In January, 1776, he was promoted to
the local rank of general in America; he proceeded
to North Carolina, and commanded the troops which
made an unsuccessful attempt on Charlestown; and
afterwards commanded a division of the army, under
General Sir William Howe, in the descent on Long
Island. In the action at Brooklyn he evinced ardour
and ability; also in the skirmish at White Plains, and in
the capture of Rhode Island, in December, the same
year. In 1777, he commanded the troops at New York,
and captured forts Clinton and Montgomery, and was
rewarded with the order of the Bath. In 1778 he was
appointed commander-in-chief in North America; in
May he joined the army at Philadelphia from whence he
withdrew to New York, and while on the march he repulsed
an attack of the Americans at Freehold. He subsequently
had success in several affairs of minor importance;
and while engaged in these services, he was
appointed to the colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Seventh</span> dragoons.
In December, 1779, he embarked with a large force for
South Carolina, and, after overcoming numerous difficulties,
he captured Charlestown, for which he received
the thanks of parliament. He sustained the character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
of a brave, zealous, and accomplished officer; but he
was so circumstanced in America, that he was unable
to add much to his reputation by the energetic and
gallant efforts which he made in that country; and
after experiencing pain and mortification from numerous
causes, he returned to England in June, 1782,
having been succeeded by General Carleton, afterwards
Lord Dorchester.</p>

<p>The rank of general in the army was conferred on
<span class="smcap">Sir Henry Clinton</span> in 1793; he held the government
of Limerick; and in 1795 he was appointed governor
of Gibraltar. He was many years a member of parliament;
and was also groom of the bedchamber to the
Duke of Gloucester. His decease occurred on the 23rd
of December, 1795.</p>


<p class="p2 center smcap">David Dundas.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 26th December, 1795.</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap">David Dundas</span> was one of the most distinguished
officers of the age in which he lived, for his perfect
knowledge of the principles of military tactics. He
commenced his military education at the age of thirteen
in the academy at Woolwich, and at fifteen he
assisted in a survey of Scotland; in 1756 obtained a
commission in the fifty-sixth regiment. In 1758 he proceeded
with the expedition to the coast of France as an
assistant quarter-master-general; and in the following
year obtained the command of a troop in a newly-raised
regiment of light dragoons (Eliott's light horse), now
the fifteenth, or King's hussars. He served with his
regiment in Germany in 1760 and 1761; in the following
summer he accompanied an expedition to Cuba, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
aide-de-camp to Major-General Eliott, and was actively
employed in the reduction of the Havannah. After the
peace he resumed his post in his regiment, in which he
rose to the rank of major; and, urged by an ardent
desire to acquire a perfect knowledge of every branch
of his profession, he obtained permission to proceed to
the continent, to observe the practice of the French
and Austrian armies. In 1775 he procured the lieut.-colonelcy
of the twelfth light dragoons, joined the regiment
in Ireland shortly afterwards, and in 1778 obtained
the appointment of quarter-master-general in that country.
In 1782 he was removed to the lieut.-colonelcy of
the second Irish horse, now the fifth dragoon guards. In
1785 he again proceeded to the continent, attended the
exercises of the Prussian troops during three summers,
and after his return he presented His Majesty with a
detailed account of their evolutions.</p>

<p>Colonel Dundas, having become a proficient tactician,
produced, in 1788, a highly useful work on the principles
of military movements, which became the basis of our
army regulations for field exercises. His abilities obtained
for him the favour and attention of King George
III., who appointed him adjutant-general in Ireland,
for the purpose of introducing his system of tactics
into the army of that country. In 1790 Colonel Dundas
was promoted to the rank of major-general. In
1791 he obtained the colonelcy of the twenty-second
foot, and in the same year was placed on the Irish staff,
but he resigned that appointment in 1793 to engage in
service of actual warfare. After the commencement of
hostilities with the French republic, Major-General
Dundas was employed on a military mission to the
island of Jersey, and was subsequently sent to the con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>tinent
to confer with the Duke of York respecting the
siege of Dunkirk. From Flanders he proceeded to
Toulon, which had recently been taken possession of by
a British armament; and his services there, although he
was ultimately obliged to evacuate the place, called forth
the approbation of his sovereign and of the British
nation. After abandoning Toulon, he made a descent
on Corsica, which island was reduced and annexed to
the British dominions; but shortly afterwards he received
directions to proceed to Flanders, where he
arrived in the spring of 1794, and commanded a brigade
of cavalry at the battle of Tournay on the 22d of May,
1794. Major-General Dundas was actively employed
in the retreat through Holland, and the corps under his
immediate command gained considerable advantage
over the enemy in two successive actions near Gelder-Malsen;
he highly distinguished himself also in an
attack upon the French post at Thuyl, in December of
the same year. He continued with the British troops
in Germany during the summer of 1795, and in December
was appointed colonel of the <span class="smcap">Seventh</span> Light
Dragoons. After his return to England he was appointed
quarter-master-general to the army; and he
composed the celebrated regulations for the field exercises
and movements for the cavalry, which were approved
by his Royal Highness the Duke of York and
by King George III., and ordered to be exclusively
adopted throughout the cavalry.</p>

<p>In 1799 Lieut.-General Dundas commanded a division
of the allied army under the Duke of York, in
the expedition to Holland; he distinguished himself in
several actions with the enemy, and was highly commended
by His Royal Highness in his public despatches.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
In 1801 he was appointed colonel of the second, or
Royal North British dragoons, and was constituted
governor of Fort George. In 1802 he was promoted to
the rank of general; and in the following year, when the
French were preparing to invade England, he was placed
in command of the troops in the southern district, which
comprised the counties of Kent and Sussex. In 1804
he was appointed governor of the Royal Hospital at
Chelsea, and created a Knight of the Bath. On the
18th of March, 1809, His Majesty was pleased to confer
on this distinguished veteran the appointment of
commander-in-chief of the army, on the resignation of
Field-Marshal His Royal Highness the Duke of York,
which appointment he held until the 25th of May, 1811,
when His Royal Highness was re-appointed. He was
also appointed colonel-in-chief of the rifle brigade on
the 31st of August, 1809. He was promoted to the
colonelcy of the King's dragoon guards on the 27th of
January, 1813. He died in 1820, after a distinguished
service of upwards of sixty years.</p>

"The Earl of Lothian's regiment of dragoons (as I remember)
consists of six companys, each company, including serjeants
corporals, and drummers, is thirty men. The colonel's character
is already given. The lieut.-colonel is son to Polwarth, now
called Earl of Marchmont. When the late Earl of Hume listed,
this lieut.-colonel was thought well-affected, and very much
under the influence of Hume; but what to say of him now I
know not. The major of the regiment, John Johnston of
Westraw, is reported to have loyal inclinations, being much
managed that way by his very loyal lady, whom few of any side
must trust."</p></div>

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
